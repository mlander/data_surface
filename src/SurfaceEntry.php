/**
 * One key of a surface, and everything the surface knows about it.
 *
 * Before this existed the surface held five arrays keyed by the same
 * names — the definitions, the refinement map, the refiner chains, the
 * locked keys and the contributed values — and every one of them could
 * be out of step with the others. An entry is the single answer to
 * "what does this surface say about this key", validated once when the
 * map around it is built.
 *
 * The refiner chains and the contributed values live here rather than
 * beside the map because refinement needs all three of them for one key
 * at a time: the advertised definition to clone, the contributions to
 * divide its option space by, and the chains to run over each slice.
 * Policy filters and the surface's own cacheability are not per key and
 * stay on the surface.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\data_surface\DefinitionMap
 *   The ordered collection of entries a surface is sealed with.

   *   Whether the key's value is fixed to what storage holds, or to the
   *   declared default when storage holds nothing.
   * @param string[] $dependencies
   *   The sibling keys this key's refinement reads, in declaration
   *   order. Empty for a key that never refines.

   *   The values contributed to this key at build time, keyed by the
   *   provider that added them. What is not here is the owner's.

   *   The child surface fixed at this key, when the key is a mount: its
   *   definition is then the child's definitions as a map.
   * @param \Drupal\data_surface\SurfaceSlot|null $slot
   *   The variant table, when the key is a slot whose shape a sibling
   *   chooses: its definition is then the `any` placeholder until the
   *   sibling holds a value, and that variant's map afterwards.
