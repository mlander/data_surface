 * Says which variants this structure is one of, and for which value.
 *
 * Variants are the structures a sibling key chooses between, attached at
 * one key with attachVariants(); each is the variant for one value of the
 * deciding key. The child declares it, so the parent never has to know
 * its children: a new field type brings its own settings structure.
 *
 * Discovery collects it, and the build step adds this structure to the
 * variants at the key it names, for the value it names. A deciding key
 * that declares no list of its own is offered the variants' values, each
 * by its variant's label; a list it declares narrows them.
 *
 * Decision: see docs/decisions.md#variants-not-slots.
