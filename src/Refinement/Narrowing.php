/**
 * The check that refinement only ever narrows.
 *
 * The module's loudest claim is that a surface advertises what it
 * accepts and refinement can only make that smaller, so a consumer that
 * read the advertisement is never surprised by a value space it did not
 * see. That claim is worth nothing as a convention: it has to be checked
 * on every link of every chain and on every policy filter, which is what
 * this does.
 *
 * The check is conservative, because it is applied to arbitrary
 * constraints written by arbitrary modules and a wrong "this is
 * narrower" is worse than a refused refinement:
 *
 * | Change | Verdict |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | Adding a constraint | narrower |
 * | Dropping values from a list of allowed values | narrower |
 * | Raising a Length or Range minimum, lowering its maximum | narrower |
 * | Adding a Length or Range bound where there was none | narrower |
 * | Sharpening a label, description, default or example | neither |
 * | Changing the data type (except away from 'any') | refused |
 * | Turning off the required flag | refused |
 * | Removing a constraint | refused |
 * | Replacing the options of any other constraint | refused |
 * | Adding or removing a map property | refused |
 * | Removing a contributed shape | narrower |
 * | Adding or replacing a contributed shape | refused |
 * | Anything above, inside a map property or a list item | as above |
 *
 * The last row is the conservative half: two Regex patterns cannot be
 * compared for containment, so replacing one is refused rather than
 * guessed at. A refiner that has to swap such a constraint says so by
 * advertising the narrower one in the first place.
 *
 * 'any' is the one declared escape hatch: it advertises nothing, so
 * every type is narrower than it. That is also the one way a shape may
 * appear during refinement — a slot's placeholder resolving to the map
 * of a variant the surface declared statically.
 *
 * Inside a map the rules recurse. A refined map holds exactly the
 * properties it was handed — gaining one would accept a key nobody was
 * told about, losing one would refuse a key everybody was — and every
 * property is held to this same table, as is a list's item definition.
