/**
 * A sealed child at one key of its parent: an attached structure.
 *
 * What attach() leaves on the entry it declares, and what each variant
 * is. The child is a whole data surface, not a copy of its
 * definitions: its own refiners, locked keys, secrets and defaults travel
 * with it, so the pipeline and the form hand the value at the key to the
 * child and let it answer for itself, and its refiners run in the
 * child's own frame, under the names the child gave its keys, never under
 * a parent path. That is the wall the pattern draws between a parent and
 * its child, enforced by construction: nothing in the parent can name a
 * key inside the child, and nothing in the child can see the parent.
 *
 * The source is the class the child was built from, when it was built
 * from one, so whatever reads the parent can say which structure (or
 * resource) sits at the key and route its values to that class's own
 * storage; the id is that class's #[Structure] or #[Resource] id, so
 * whatever reads only data surfaces, as the contract emitter does, can
 * name the child without the registry.
 *
 * The one thing a child reads from outside its frame is its ports, the
 * values it declared it reads with BlueprintInterface::reads(), each wired
 * by its container to one of the container's keys. The wiring travels
 * here, and bound() hands the child the values its container's keys hold
 * now: the child still names nothing of its container's, and its
 * container names nothing inside it.
 *
 * A variant the site lists may be held unsettled: its child is built the
 * first time something reads it (SettlesChildInterface), and kept.
 * Reading `child` settles it; isSettled() asks without building.
 *
 * @property-read \Drupal\data_surface\DataSurfaceInterface $child
 *   The sealed child, as it was advertised, built now if it was not yet.
