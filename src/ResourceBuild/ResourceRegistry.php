/**
 * Every resource, structure and shape, with operations, alters, variants.
 *
 * The compiler pass lists the classes in src/Resource, src/Structure,
 * src/Shape and src/Alter; the plugin definitions list the plugins that
 * are their own structure (#[UsesStructure] with no argument). This
 * reads their attributes and caches what it read in the discovery bin,
 * the way a plugin manager caches its definitions, in two layers: an
 * index (every name and id, its kind and provider, and the shapes),
 * and one entry per definition, read by name when it is asked for and
 * kept for the rest of the request. A request that builds one resource
 * reads the index and what that resource names, never the whole of
 * discovery. The cache ids carry a hash of both lists, so a container
 * rebuilt with a module more or less, or a plugin more or less, is a
 * different set of entries and needs no clearing; an attribute edited
 * in place needs a cache rebuild, exactly as a plugin attribute does.
 *
 * A deriver (#[DerivesResources]) is asked for its resources here too,
 * and each is read into a definition with no class, under the id
 * `<base>:<derivative>`. What it derived from is live site state, so
 * each derivative's entry carries the cache tags it names, and only
 * those: a field saved clears that field's structure and its bundle's
 * resource. The index carries what decides which derivatives there are
 * (KnowsDerivativeListTagsInterface), so a bundle created or a form
 * display saved reads the list again; reading it again derives
 * everything, and writes only the entries whose tags fired or whose
 * content changed, every other one kept as it was cached. Through
 * ResourceRegistryInvalidator, an invalidation also reaches what this
 * request already read.
 *
 * Two kinds of refusal, kept apart on purpose:
 * - What is wrong with the attributes themselves (an operation with
 *   nothing to belong to, an operation method that is not static, a
 *   class whose defineInputs() is not static, two classes claiming one id,
 *   a class with the attribute of one kind and the interface of the
 *   other, a reference to a class that exists and is neither a resource
 *   nor a structure) is refused here, when discovery is read, because it
 *   cannot be pinned on one build.
 * - What is wrong with one resource or structure (two operations with
 *   one id, a refiner watching a key it never declares) is
 *   refused when that one is asked for, naming the offender, so one
 *   module's mistake does not take every other one down with it.
 *
 * Decision: see docs/decisions.md#what-is-paid-once-and-what-per-request.
