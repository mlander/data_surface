/**
 * Turns a sealed data surface and its values into the served contract.
 *
 * The contract is JSON Schema 2020-12 for the inputs, with one extension
 * keyword, `x-surface`, on every property for what JSON Schema has no
 * word for, plus the values the schema describes right now. It is the
 * module's canonical contract, and its own emitter rather than the Tool
 * API's, so it can say what a Tool API context definition cannot carry:
 *
 * - allowed values as `oneOf: [{const, title}]`, labels included, read
 *   from the options service: the same list a generated select renders
 *   and the pipeline validates against;
 * - variants as real conditionals on their parent: per variant, one `if`
 *   naming the deciding key's `const` and one `then` naming its shape,
 *   so the union is stated where JSON Schema can state it;
 * - per key, what the data surface knows about it beyond its shape
 *   (`x-surface`): whether it is locked, which siblings its refiners
 *   watch, whether it is narrowed right now, whether a select shows its
 *   empty option and under what label, and whether the value it holds
 *   has gone stale;
 * - where a key's static refiners have nothing to refine against yet,
 *   what they would answer for every value their watched siblings could
 *   take, as conditionals on the parent beside the variants'
 *   (Conditionals::enumerate()), so a static contract is exact wherever
 *   the answers are finite; where
 *   they are not, that the key is `refine`, to be asked again with
 *   values; and where a runtime refiner narrows it too, that the key is
 *   `live`, which no schema states ahead of time.
 *
 * Everything is read from the data surface: the declared shape for what
 * it advertises, the same data surface refined against the values for
 * what it allows now, each child in its own frame. Nothing names a
 * resource, a structure or a key, and nothing here reaches storage: the
 * values are handed in.
 *
 * Each child is a reusable subschema. The wall between a parent and
 * its child (the parent cannot refine into the child, the child cannot
 * watch the parent, the child keeps its own refiners and alters) makes a
 * child self-contained, so it is written once under the root's `$defs`,
 * keyed by its own id, as its own frame declares it for no values
 * (define()). Each place it is used, an attached key or a variant's
 * conditional, refers to it, beside what that place says about it: its
 * label, its `x-surface`. Where the child here says more than its def (a
 * key its context locked, a key refined for the values in this
 * document), the reference is composed with only what differs, as
 * `allOf: [{$ref}, {narrowing}]` (PropertySchema::reference()):
 * refinement only narrows,
 * so that is refinement in the schema's own grammar.
 * Decision: see docs/decisions.md#the-wall-is-the-reference-boundary.
 *
 * There are two documents, written by the one code path below so they
 * cannot drift apart:
 *
 * - emit(): the schema as it stands, for one set of values. A key whose
 *   watched siblings hold values is refined for them, `x-surface` says
 *   what is true right now, and `values` and `stale` sit beside the
 *   schema. It is what a form is drawn from, and it describes those
 *   values only.
 * - emitFull(): the full schema, for any values. It reads no value at
 *   all: every key is the one the data surface declares, every dependency
 *   that can be listed is stated for every value it could be handed, and
 *   one that cannot is marked `refine`. It is what a validator, or
 *   anything that takes the schema once, holds values to.
 *
 * Neither is ever stricter than the pipeline: a rule JSON Schema cannot
 * state, or a dependency too large to list, is left out and named, never
 * approximated by something narrower.
 * Decision: see
 * docs/decisions.md#two-documents-never-stricter-than-the-runtime.
 *
 * The contract carries no widget vocabulary unless a renderer asks for
 * it (emit()'s $widgets). Then `x-surface.widget` mirrors
 * DataSurfaceWidgetManager's selection in its weight order, so a
 * renderer such as data_surface_react's app draws what the operation
 * form would: a non-empty option list is a select (a list of them, a
 * multiple select, said by `multiple`); a map with properties is a
 * fieldset; a string is a textarea when its definition says multiline,
 * a time input when it asks for one, an email input for the email type,
 * a text input otherwise; a number is a number input; a boolean a
 * checkbox. A list of values is checkboxes or a multiple select, and one
 * value radios when it asks for them, by the widgets' own rule
 * (CheckboxesWidget::drawsList(), RadiosWidget::drawsOne()); a list with
 * no option list is `list`, rows to add and remove. A key a module's
 * widget claims (DataSurfaceWidgetManager::claimed()) is that widget's
 * word, ahead of the stock rule, unless its owner asked for one with the
 * `widget` setting. One hint has no
 * Form API counterpart here: `variants`, for a key with variants, whose
 * shape a sibling chooses.
 *
 * Both documents are written in one version of the wire format, the
 * contract's own (CONTRACT, stated as `x-surface.contract`), distinct
 * from a resource's version. In contract 2 no `x-surface` sits below an
 * applicator (`allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `if`, `then`, `else`, `not`), so
 * a tool that merges `allOf` meets plain JSON Schema there: the object
 * owning the applicator says which of its conditionals are declared
 * rules (`x-surface.rules`) and what a narrowing says of a key inside it
 * (`x-surface.within`, by JSON pointer), and every narrowing states the
 * declared `type` beside a keyword only one type reads
 * (DocumentHead::settled()).
 * Decision: see docs/decisions.md#contract-2.
 *
 * This class is the walk: it visits every frame, key, child, variant,
 * collection item and mount, and files each child's def. Three internal
 * classes write what the walk asks for: PropertySchema describes one key
 * as a property, Conditionals writes what a key's refiners answer as
 * conditionals, and DocumentHead writes what sits above the properties.
 * Both documents share the walk, so the seam is the responsibility and
 * not the document.
 * Decision: see
 * docs/decisions.md#the-emitter-is-one-walk-and-three-writers.

   * - a key whose answers cannot be listed keeps its declared schema and
   *   is `refine`: wider than what the pipeline will allow for some
   *   values, never narrower, and to be asked about with values;
   * - variants are their conditionals, and every child's frame is described
   *   by the same rule, from nothing, not from the child's defaults;
   * - a runtime refiner contributes nothing but `live: true` on the key
   *   it narrows: it is never run here, so the key keeps the width its
   *   static refiners give it, wider than the pipeline for some values;
   * - access is the account's: emitted from a data surface built for the
   *   account alone (ResourcesInterface::buildStatic()), a key a static
   *   answer locked is `readOnly`, one it left out is not there, and one a
   *   runtime answer may still lock or leave out is there, as the static
   *   answers leave it, marked `live`, as a key a runtime refiner narrows
   *   is; the schema for these answers settles it;
   * - a list the site decides past the site list limit is `deferred`:
   *   open, its `deferred` object holding a `fetch` template naming the
   *   choice that states one of its entries; with choices, each one chosen
   *   is stated in full at its key, as under the limit, and every other
   *   entry is still left out;
   * - `x-surface` carries only what holds for any values: `dependsOn`,
   *   `enumerated`, `deferred`, `refine`, `live`, the variants' `by` and
   *   `variants`, `group`, `after`, `patternMessage`, `checkedOnServer`,
