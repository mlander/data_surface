/**
 * One tool per operation of every resource that names its storage.
 *
 * The pattern's "one tool per operation, its inputs being the parameters
 * plus the resource's open keys", made from the static layer alone: the
 * resources discovery found, the operations on each, and what each
 * operation's signature says it needs. The derivative id is
 * `<resource id>:<operation id>`, so a plugin id reads
 * `surface:node.type:create`: the address the pattern gives an
 * operation.
 *
 * Two rules say which operations are not tools, and the catalog
 * applies the same ones (ResourceCatalog::standalone()). A resource or
 * structure that names no storage, or that a plugin names with
 * #[UsesStructure], has no tool: its host supplies the storage (a
 * parent, or a plugin's configuration), and only the host holds it. And
 * an operation whose permission has a `%key` placeholder none of its
 * parameters can supply is not a tool, because nothing a caller sends
 * could name the permission it asks for: the field storage's add, which
 * only a field adding its storage can ask. A
 * resource or operation that cannot be described (two operations with
 * one id, an operation returning a context with another's id, a
 * parameter no tool can send) is left out and logged, so one module's
 * mistake does not take every other tool down with it; building that
 * resource reports it by name.
 *
 * An operation that needs nothing is described in its real context. One
 * that changes a thing that exists lists no defaults: a key left out keeps
 * its current value, which its read tool returns, and the definitions are
 * cached, so a stored value listed here would go stale unseen.
 *
 * The definitions are cached for every account, so they are no account's:
 * each resource is built for no account (every access answer set aside
 * and its key marked) and derived as the anonymous account, so an option
 * list read from the site is never a privileged account's. A tool
 * instance lists `values` again for the account that asks.
 *
 * The operation's permission is the tool's declared permission, which
 * the Tool API checks before the tool's own access and prints in
 * `tool:info`, when it is one permission as written: one with a `%key`
 * placeholder names a different permission for each thing it is asked
 * of, so it is declared nowhere and the tool's own access, which fills
 * the placeholder from the parameters, is the only check.
 *
 * Deriving is paid once per resource, not once per listing. Each
 * resource's tools are cached in an entry of their own in the discovery
 * bin, under the tags of what they were read from (the resource's
 * discovery entry and every build it was made from), each operation built
 * once for all its tools (OperationInputs::derivation()). The Tool API
 * keeps every tool as one item, which any of those tags clears
 * (ToolDefinitionsInvalidator); deriving again then reads every entry
 * whose tags did not fire and derives only the rest, inside core's lock,
 * so a burst of requests pays one rebuild and the others wait and read
 * what it wrote.
 *
 * A tool's title is its operation's label, and its description the
 * operation's description followed by one line of call rules for its
 * kind (OperationInputs::description()). No two tools share a title:
 * where operations of several resources share a label, each tool adds
 * its resource (title()); the read tool's is "Current values:" and the
 * write tool's.
 *
 * Each write tool says how its operation behaves (behaves()): the Read
 * kind for a read only operation, the Write kind for every other, and
 * whether it may destroy what is there.
 *
 * An operation that changes a thing that exists has a read tool beside
 * its write tool, `<resource id>:<operation id>:read`, of the class
 * ResourceOperationReadTool: its parameters as inputs, the stored values
 * as its output. Which operations those are is the catalog's to say
 * (ResourceCatalog::reads()), as which can be asked at all is.

   * destructive flag, and the MCP bridge turns both into a tool's
   * annotations: read only from a kind that does not modify, idempotent
   * from the kind, destructive from the flag. A read only operation is the
   * Read kind, so it is read only and idempotent there; every other is the
   * Write kind, and says whether it may destroy what is there.
   *
   * Idempotence is the kind's, not the tool's: every kind that modifies
   * is not idempotent, so an operation that changes a thing that exists,
   * which is idempotent, is a Write all the same and reads as not
   * idempotent. The least wrong kind: every kind that is idempotent does
   * not modify, so it would also say the operation changes nothing, which
   * a client would act on. Both schema documents state the operation's
