/**
 * @defgroup data_surface_resource Declaring a resource or a structure
 * @{
 * A resource or a structure is a class, discovered, built in a context
 * and sealed.
 *
 * A resource is a thing with identity and storage that operations read
 * and write: a class implementing
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\ResourceInterface and carrying
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\Attribute\Resource. A structure is a group
 * of keys with no identity or storage of its own, only ever held by
 * something else (attached to a parent, as one of the variants at a key, or
 * configuring a plugin): a class implementing
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\StructureInterface and carrying
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\Attribute\Structure. Either is found in a
 * module's src/Resource/ or src/Structure/ the way core finds a class in
 * src/Hook, so nothing registers it; the attribute, not the directory,
 * decides the kind. The build step,
 * \Drupal\data_surface\ResourceBuild\ResourcesInterface (service
 * data_surface.resources), is the only thing that builds either. The class
 * is never instantiated: its inputs and its refiners are static, called on
 * the class, so it has no constructor and holds no service, and a list
 * that depends on the site is a constraint whose options resolver fetches
 * it. Labels are built with the global t(), since a static method has
 * nothing a translation service could be injected into.
 *
 * Each part of a resource has one home:
 * - Its keys, in static defineInputs(): a flat list, no conditionals,
 *   never naming a sibling. add() takes a name, a type and a label and
 *   returns the core definition, so the rest is core API.
 * - A key whose allowed values depend on another key's value, in a static
 *   method carrying \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\Attribute\RefinesInput.
 *   It takes the key's definition first and one parameter per sibling it
 *   watches, and returns the definition narrowed. The framework checks it
 *   narrowed.
 * - How it is asked for, with
 *   \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\Attribute\Operation: its id, label,
 *   description, permission and whether it creates. On the class for an
 *   operation that needs nothing more; on a static method returning a
 *   \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\OperationContext for one that knows
 *   more, the id and creates stamped from the attribute. An identity key
 *   the context knows is locked; one it does not know stays open.
 * - Where the values are stored and what may refuse, on the attribute:
 *   storage names a \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\ResourceStorageInterface
 *   and access a \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\OperationAccessInterface,
 *   both autowired services. A structure names no storage: whatever holds
 *   it stores it.
 * - What it emits, in static defineOutputs(), on
 *   \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\DefinesOutputsInterface. Never refined.
 *
 * @code
 * #[Resource('example.thing',
 *   identity: ['id'],
 *   storage: ExampleStorage::class,
 *   access: ExampleAccess::class,
 * )]
 * #[Operation('create',
 *   label: new TranslatableMarkup('Add a thing'),

 *   creates: TRUE,
 * )]
 * final class ExampleResource implements ResourceInterface {
 *
 *   public const PERMISSION = 'administer things';
 *
 *   #[Operation('update',
 *     label: new TranslatableMarkup('Edit a thing'),
 *     description: new TranslatableMarkup('Changes a thing, named by its id.'),
 *     permission: self::PERMISSION,
 *   )]
 *   public static function update(ExampleInterface $thing): OperationContext {
 *     return new OperationContext(known: ['id' => $thing->id()]);
 *   }
 *
 *   public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
 *     $inputs->add('id', 'string', t('Machine name'))
 *       ->setRequired(TRUE);

 *       ->setRequired(TRUE)
 *       ->addConstraint('PluginExists', [
 *         'manager' => 'entity_type.manager',
 *         'interface' => ContentEntityInterface::class,
 *       ]);
 *     $inputs->add('bundle', 'string', t('Bundle'));
 *   }
 *
 *   #[RefinesInput('bundle')]
 *   public static function bundleOfEntityType(
 *     DataDefinitionInterface $bundle,
 *     string $entity_type,
 *   ): DataDefinitionInterface {
 *     return $bundle->addConstraint('EntityBundleExists', [
 *       'entityTypeId' => $entity_type,
 *     ]);
 *   }
 *
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Children are attach() for a fixed child, attachVariants() for variants a
 * sibling key chooses between and attachList() for a collection. attach()
 * and attachVariants() return the map definition at the key, which the
 * owner labels with the core setters. Variants are always open: every
 * structure carrying \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\Attribute\Variant for
 * the key is one, and the deciding key's allowed values become exactly
 * those. attachVariants($key, by: $sibling, from: Provider::class) adds the
 * variants a provider lists from the site, a
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\SiteListInterface, for the values no
 * variant class declares.
 *
 * A plugin whose configuration is a structure names it with
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\Attribute\UsesStructure and extends the host
 * base class for its type, which builds the structure in the host's own
 * context, supplies the storage and answers the static defaults:
 * @code
 * #[Block(id: 'example', admin_label: new TranslatableMarkup('Example'))]
 * #[UsesStructure(ExampleBlockStructure::class)]
 * final class ExampleBlock extends DataSurfaceBlockBase {
 *
 *   public function build(): array {
 *     return ['#markup' => $this->getConfiguration()['headline']];
 *   }
 *
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * Or the plugin is its own structure: the attribute with no argument, and
 * the plugin class implements StructureInterface with the same static
 * methods. It is found through its plugin definition rather than a
 * directory, its id is `<host type>:<plugin id>` unless the class carries
 * #[Structure] as well, and an alter names it by the plugin class:
 * @code
 * #[Block(id: 'example', admin_label: new TranslatableMarkup('Example'))]
 * #[UsesStructure]
 * final class ExampleBlock extends DataSurfaceBlockBase implements StructureInterface {
 *
 *   public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
 *     $inputs->add('headline', 'string', t('Headline'), default: 'News');
 *   }
 *
 *   public function build(): array {
 *     return ['#markup' => $this->getConfiguration()['headline']];
 *   }
 *
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * A resource that names storage and is no plugin's is served at a route by
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Form\DataSurfaceOperationForm, from the route
 * defaults _data_surface_resource and _data_surface_operation, and gated by
 * the _data_surface_operation_access requirement, which every such route
 * has without saying it (OperationRouteSubscriber).

/**
 * @defgroup data_surface_alter Extending someone else's resource or structure
 * @{
 * Adding to a resource or structure at build time, where the addition is
 * advertised.
 *
 * A class in a module's src/Alter/ carrying
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\Attribute\Alters is an alter of the
 * resource or structure it names, optionally only in some of its
 * operations. It is found and autowired as a service, so it may hold
 * services. What it adds is part of the contract every later consumer
 * reads: the generated form renders it, the pipeline accepts and validates
 * it, the storage writes it, and a machine-readable schema emitted from
 * the built resource advertises it. That is the difference from
 * hook_form_alter(), which could only add a form element nothing else
 * could see.
 *
 * An alter may:
 * - add keys, which are mounted under its module's name, at
 *   third_party_settings.<module>.<key>, so they cannot collide with the
 *   owner's or anyone else's;
 * - reword a label or a description with describe();
 * - offer more values on a key whose owner declared a fixed list, with
 *   extendChoices(), the one widening verb; a value already offered by
 *   anyone is refused;
 * - narrow any key with #[RefinesInput] methods of its own: static, as an
 *   owner's are, or instance methods declaring runtime: TRUE, since an
 *   alter is a service. On a key it offered more values on, a method is
 *   handed this module's values alone, so it can neither narrow away a
 *   value the owner offers nor hand back one it was not given; what is
 *   offered is the union.
 * Nothing an alter does removes a key or a value.
 *
 * @code
 * #[Alters(DataSurfaceDemoFormatter::class)]
 * final class MyModuleFormatterAlter implements AltersInputsInterface {
 *
 *   use StringTranslationTrait;

 *
 * An alter adds no outputs: what a call answers is its operation's, and a
 * reaction to a save belongs to ECA. An alter whose keys are asked for in
 * one layout and stored in another implements
 * \Drupal\data_surface\Resource\AltersStorageLayoutInterface. An
 * operation stands on its resource's or structure's own class only.
