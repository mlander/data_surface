# Introduction

This series introduces Surface API one idea at a time, for a Drupal
developer who has not installed it. Each page defines one word in plain
language, shows it in a picture and a short snippet, and uses only words
an earlier page defined, or links forward to the page that defines one. Nothing needs to be installed to read it. After
the last page you can name each idea and say what it is for; the build
pages then show how to write one. The series teaches the pattern; the
classes behind it are the module's own, and not all of them are settled
yet.

1. [What Surface API does](01-what-it-does.md): describe once what a
   thing accepts, and the form, a Tool API tool, the command line, the
   HTTP API and the React page accept the same values.
2. [Resources](02-resources.md): a thing your site keeps values for
   that can be asked for on its own.
3. [Structures](03-structures.md): a group of values held by something
   else, such as a block plugin's settings, held by the placed block.
4. [Shapes](04-shapes.md): one value declared once and used under many
   names.
5. [Keys](05-keys.md): one value a resource or structure holds, with a
   type, a label and a default.
6. [Rules on a key](06-rules-on-a-key.md): what a key allows, such as
   required, a length or a range.
7. [Rules between keys](07-rules-between-keys.md): what one key allows
   can depend on another key's value.
8. [Which one: identity](08-identity.md): the keys that say which one,
   and the resources that exist once.
9. [Operations](09-operations.md): one way of asking for a resource,
   each with its permission.
10. [Storage](10-storage.md): where the values are saved, which the
    resource does not depend on.
11. [Resources made of structures](11-resources-made-of-structures.md):
    a structure held under one key, or one of several chosen by another
    key.
12. [Doors](12-doors.md): the form, the tool, the command line, MCP,
    ECA, HTTP and the React page, and the submodule that opens each.
13. [Other modules](13-other-modules.md): a module adds keys to a
    resource it does not own, or tightens its rules.
14. [The site and the page](14-site-and-page.md): a site's own defaults,
    and values a route starts or fixes.
15. [Access](15-access.md): which keys an account may change or see.
16. [Sealed](16-sealed.md): who has a say in what an operation
    accepts, in order, and why that answer stops changing before the
    form, the tool or HTTP reads it.
17. [A value sent in](17-a-value-sent-in.md): the steps every value
    takes, and why every door refuses it with the same message.
18. [Where next](18-where-next.md): install it, build your first
    resource, look things up, try the examples.
