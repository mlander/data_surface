# Surface API documentation

Every page of the documentation, in four sections and the project's own
records. This page only points; each linked page explains its idea.

## Introduction

[The introduction](introduction/index.md): short pages, one idea each,
for a Drupal developer who has never used the module. Nothing to
install; read it first.

## Build

- [Your first resource](first-resource.md): a settings page from a
  resource, an operation, a storage and `add()`, pinned to the shipped
  module `surface_examples_first`.
- [Your second resource](second-resource.md): one key whose allowed
  values depend on another's, with one refiner.
- [A plugin's settings](plugin-settings.md): give a block, formatter or
  condition plugin a generated settings form.
- [Testing a resource](testing-a-resource.md): `ResourceTestBase`, the
  invariants (never stricter, the round trip, static agreement, every
  door, the baseline) held for your own resources from one kernel test.
- [Generating a resource](generating.md): `drush generate
  surface:resource`, the first page's files from an interview, a config
  schema entry or a JSON Schema document, and the comments it leaves for
  what it cannot write.
- [Common settings recipes](recipes.md): a time of day, a multi-select,
  a text area and the other keys a settings page often asks for, one
  snippet each.
- [See what your site has](catalog-command.md): `drush surface:catalog`,
  every resource and structure on a site, each operation's doors, one in
  full, and what did not build.

## Reference

### Look up a term or a concept

- [Glossary](glossary.md): every term, its plain and its precise
  definition.
- [Concepts](concepts.md): every concept, the question that makes you
  need it, when to skip it, and the page that shows it; its
  [Namespaces](concepts.md#namespaces) table gives each class's `use`
  line.
- [The pattern](pattern.md): what an author writes, where it goes, and
  why it is shaped that way.
- [How it fits](how-it-fits.md): one build followed from the caller to
  a sealed data surface.
- [Transformations](transformations.md): a value asked for one way and
  stored another (coercion, layouts, the doors' wire forms), what runs
  because something was saved, and a value nobody types.

### Writing a resource

- [Declaring a resource or structure](declaring-a-resource.md): the
  class, adopting it [on a plugin](declaring-a-resource.md#on-a-plugin),
  defaults, locking, secrets, required.
- [Resources and structures](resources.md): [which way to compose](resources.md#which-way-to-compose), operations, alters,
  attached structures and variants, variants from the site, ports,
  mixins, collections, keys from the site, access, storage, tools, the
  catalog.
- [Reading a schema](reading-a-schema.md): a JSON Schema read into a
  structure: the mapping, what is kept and checked on the server, what
  is noted and refused, older drafts, the round trip.
- [Refinement](refinement.md): an alter offering values and a refiner
  narrowing them, a rule declared as data, a key that does not apply,
  the narrowing table, cacheability, a worked example, and what it does
  not reach yet.
- [Options and resolvers](options.md): `LabeledChoice`, the resolver
  plugin type, the stock resolvers.
- [Storage](storage.md): what storage is, prepare and commit, the
  engine storage classes (a simple config object first), config schema,
  settings layouts, secrets, the serialization rule.
- [Outputs](outputs.md): declaring what a host emits, the `NotEmitted`
  sentinel, conformance, its two consumers, an alter's outputs.
- [Widgets](widgets.md): the widget plugin type, and writing one.
- [Generated forms](forms.md): host families, the merge rule, AJAX,
  extraction, stale values, the operation form with its panel and
  cosmetic seam.
- [Content entities](entities.md): a content entity's create and update
  form as a derived resource, one structure per field, field access as
  each child's access.
- [Evolving a resource](evolution.md): which changes are compatible, the
  version, stored-value migrations as designed, and the contract diff
  that holds a module to its baselines.
- `surface.api.php`, beside the module's README: resource and
  structure classes, alters and the two plugin types, for the API
  reference.

### The doors

- [The served contract](served-contract.md): an operation as JSON Schema
  with `x-surface`, its refine and validate endpoints, and the React form
  rendered from it.
- [The pipeline](pipeline.md): access, accept, validate, prepare,
  commit; dry runs; exceptions.
- [Value semantics](semantics.md): configured or not, the coercion
  table (the Tool API's), secrets, stale values, type mismatches,
  required, locked keys.
- [The Tool API door](tools.md): one tool per operation, a read tool
  and a narrowing tool beside it, who may run them, the contract panel,
  and what MCP and the Tool API are told. Enabling it:
  [Installation: Tool](installation.md#tool), for an agent, MCP and
  Drush. The field tools are an example of their own,
  [`surface_examples_field`](https://github.com/mlander/surface/blob/main/modules/surface_examples_field/README.md).
- [The React app](https://github.com/mlander/surface/blob/main/modules/surface_react/README.md): the served
  contract's endpoints and the React form drawn from them.
- [The OpenAPI document](https://github.com/mlander/surface/blob/main/modules/surface_openapi/README.md):
  every operation's endpoints as OpenAPI 3.1, for any OpenAPI client,
  generator or UI.
- [The component block](https://github.com/mlander/surface/blob/main/modules/surface_examples_component_block/README.md):
  a block that embeds a single-directory component, its settings a
  structure.
- [Block placement](https://github.com/mlander/surface/blob/main/modules/surface_examples_block/README.md): a placed
  block of any plugin as a resource, placed, configured and removed
  through a tool, HTTP and a form.

### Running it

- [Installation](installation.md): install, production settings,
  integrations, and every submodule with its install command.
- [Catalog](catalog.md): every resource and structure the modules here
  declare, with each operation's doors, as `drush surface:catalog
  --format=markdown` writes it for this repository.
- [Performance](performance.md): what is kept across requests, what each
  door builds, and the numbers.

### Detailed diagrams

- [Visuals](visuals/index.html): seven small drawings, one relationship
  each: resource, structure and shape; who may ask; the layers; the
  markers; six ways to compose; the doors; the pipeline. Open the file
  in a browser.

## Examples

[Examples](examples/index.md): the example and demo modules, one row
each, with the concept it shows, its install command, its page on a
site and the page that explains the idea. Neither the introduction nor
the build pages need them.

## Project records

The project's own records: why each rule is what it is, what it was
held to, and what it proposes for core. None of it is needed to use the
module.

- [Decisions](decisions.md): the points the pattern left open, and how
  the module settled them. Every page states a rule itself and links its
  reason in one form, `(why: decision)`, which you may skip.
- [Core gaps](core-gaps.md): the core proposal: what core lacks,
  bottom-up in the order it could be added, each step with its issue and
  what it gives alone.
- [Adoption catalog](adoption.md): where core can adopt this, group by
  group.
- [Audit: never stricter than the runtime](audit-never-stricter.md):
  where the schema could be stricter than the pipeline, case by case,
  each verdict pinned by a test.

Logs of people and agents who did not write the module, each kept as
written:

- [Fresh eyes, 2026-10-18](fresh-eyes-2026-10-18.md): a newcomer builds
  a settings page from the documentation alone.
- [Fresh eyes, 2026-10-19](fresh-eyes-2026-10-19.md): a second newcomer
  builds a library's opening hours, a reused structure and an alter.
- [Fresh eyes three, 2026-10-19](fresh-eyes-2026-10-19b.md): a third
  newcomer builds a digest's settings from the documentation alone.
- [Fresh eyes four, 2026-10-21](fresh-eyes-2026-10-21.md): a fourth
  newcomer builds a rental's settings, with a shape, a port and an alter,
  from the docs alone.
- [Two adopters, 2026-10-19](adopters-2026-10-19.md): two contributed
  modules' settings forms, pathauto's and honeypot's, ported as
  resources.
- [Pathauto again, 2026-10-26](adopters-2026-10-26.md): pathauto's
  settings form re-ported a week later from the docs alone, as a size
  measurement and a fourth newcomer run: the line counts side by side,
  and what the form builder still gets wrong.
- [Reviews, 2026-10-20](reviews-2026-10-20/synthesis.md): the synthesis
  of thirteen developer-experience reviews; each review is in
  [the same directory](reviews-2026-10-20/).
- [API consolidation, 2026-10-24](reviews-2026-10-24/api-consolidation.md):
  a decision list of renames, merges and drops across the API.
