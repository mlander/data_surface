/**
 * A placed block: where it is, what it shows, and when.
 *
 * The block config entity, `block.block.<id>`, is the resource, by its
 * machine name. Its plugin chooses its settings, as a sibling key
 * chooses variants: a plugin that declares its settings as a structure
 * is that structure, and any other is read from its config schema
 * (BlockPluginStructures). The keys every block has, its label and
 * whether the label shows, are the resource's own, beside its theme,
 * region, weight and status; its visibility is a list of conditions,
 * each a condition plugin's settings chosen the same way.
 *
 * Three operations: add places a block under a machine name the caller
 * types, edit changes one in its theme, and remove takes it away. Each
 * asks "administer blocks", the block layout's permission.
