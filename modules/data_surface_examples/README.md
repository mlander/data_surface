# Data Surface Examples

One resource that grows, one idea per example. The thing being described is
the settings of an event registration: a title, how many people, where,
what it costs, who to contact. Each example adds one idea, each example with a
form is a page of its own, and under each form, collapsed, is the contract the
form was built from: every key, what it allows right now, and the JSON
Schema a caller with no form is handed. Below that, collapsed too, is
the before picture: what the same caller could be told today, from
config schema alone.

Examples 7 to 12 leave the registration behind: each is a small resource
of its own for one or two later concepts, a rule written as data, a part
used twice, keys that come from the site, access, the stock widgets, and
a JSON Schema read into a structure
([below](#one-small-resource-per-concept)). Example 13 is example 12's
two lines as the settings of a block, which lives in a submodule of its
own, placed through the general placement resource of another
([below](#example-13-a-block-that-embeds-a-component)). Example 14 is an
optional extension: a credential pasted as a secret, or a key the site
manages once a submodule standing in for the Key module is on, built
once by the owner and once by that submodule's alter
([below](#example-14-an-optional-extension)). Example 15 is a config
entity type of the module's own, a venue, with a resource over it from
the start: one venue added, edited and removed, the venues listed a
page at a time and reordered in one write
([below](#example-15-a-config-entity-of-your-own)). Example 16 is a key
that refers to an entity, declared by the data type string of what it
refers to, listed while the site has few and looked up past that, in a
submodule that needs node
([below](#example-16-references-three-ways)).

```bash
drush pm:install data_surface_examples
```

Then visit `/surface-examples` as an administrator. Every page asks for
"administer site configuration", example 15's for "administer event
venues", and example 16's for "set event sponsorship". Nothing else is needed: the venues and rooms are the three
venues the module ships, example 15's config entities, and each example
keeps its settings in a config object of its own
(`data_surface_examples.registration_step1` to `_step3`, then
`data_surface_examples.bulletin`, `.press`, `.desk`, `.sales`,
`.program`, `.doors`, `.spotlight`, `.mailer` and `.webhook`), so the examples never write over
each other.

To take the examples again from the start, follow **Reset to defaults**
on the landing page (`/surface-examples/reset`). It puts every config
object back to the files the module ships in `config/install`, the
ticket types example 9 reads among them, puts example 15's three venues
back as shipped and removes any venue added since,
including anything another module stored on them, such as the event
license example 4's module adds under example 3, and it opens again
every room example 4 lets a site close and clears example 10's workflow
state.

## What a resource is, in one paragraph

A resource is a class that says what a piece of software accepts: each
value's name, type, label, and what it may hold, and the storage that
keeps it. It says nothing about forms. The form is generated from it,
the validation is its, and the same class is a tool an agent can call.
A part a resource holds, with no storage of its own, is a structure,
declared the same way. The rule that makes this work is that a resource
may only ever *narrow* what it said: once a caller has read it, nothing
it accepts later contradicts what it advertised.

## Without a resource: what config schema can say

Under the contract panel of examples 1 to 3 is a second one, collapsed
as "Without a resource: what config schema can say". It is what a client
could be told about the same settings today, when the options, the
limits and what depends on what are written in Form API code and the
only declarative description is the config schema. It holds two
documents that read no resource, and a table that sets the second beside
the resource's contract:

- **What core answers when asked for a JSON Schema.** The example's
  typed config, normalized by core's serializer in the `json_schema`
  format. It is asked each time, not written down. The answer is one
  `$comment`, saying no schema is defined for a mapping. That is core's
  whole answer, not an error, and the panel says so above it: core has
  no JSON Schema for a config mapping, and the page the comment links says
  how code implements a schema.
- **The most a plain mapping of config schema could say.**
  `ConfigSchemaContract` reads the schema definition and translates it
  one to one: a label is a `title`, a type a `type`, a mapping an
  object, and a constraint the schema declares the keyword JSON Schema
  has for it. The examples' schema is written from their resources
  (`drush data_surface:config-schema`), fully validatable, so it carries
  each key's type and label, its bounds, what is always held and what
  null may clear; a list of values it leaves to the resource, which keeps
  a value a list no longer offers as stale. Example 1:

<!-- json: data_surface_examples.registration_step1 -->

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "title": "Registration settings, example 1",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "title": {
            "title": "Event title",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "capacity": {
            "title": "Capacity",
            "type": [
                "integer",
                "null"
            ],
            "minimum": 1,
            "maximum": 1000
        },
        "open": {
            "title": "Registration open",
            "type": [
                "boolean",
                "null"
            ]
        }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false,
    "required": [
        "title",
        "capacity",
        "open"
    ]
}
```

The capacity's bounds are there, every key is required to be stored, and
null clears the two optional ones; `additionalProperties: false`
because a mapping in config schema refuses a key it does not list. What
a schema generated from the resource does not say is the lists of values
and what depends on what: in example 3 the venue, the room and the
pricing are strings with no list, and the ticket has
a title and a `$comment`: its type is
`data_surface_examples.registration_step3.ticket.[%parent.pricing]`,
which only a stored value resolves, and this reads none.

- **Key by key.** A table counted from two documents, one row per key
  the resource declares: the JSON Schema keywords the mapping states,
  beside those the resource's full schema states, the one the contract
  panel shows as "The full schema, for any answers". The venue reads
  `title, type` beside `title, type, oneOf (3)`, the room `title, type`
  beside `title, type, oneOf (6), if/then on venue (3 cases)`, the
  ticket `title, $comment` beside
  `title, anyOf, if/then on pricing (2 variants: free has note, $ref (registration.step3.ticket.free); paid has price, currency, $ref (registration.step3.ticket.paid))`,
  the contact `title, type, properties, additionalProperties, required`
  beside
  `title, type, properties, additionalProperties, required, $ref (registration.contact)`,
  and the last row lists what is required: every key, which a fully
  validatable schema asks to be stored, beside
  `title, venue, room, pricing`, which a caller must give. The resource writes each part once,
  under `$defs`, and refers to it where it is used; the table counts
  what a reference resolves to and names the reference beside it.

None of them reads a value, so nothing in this panel moves while the
form is filled in. What follows the answers is the contract panel above
it: its table, and "The schema for these answers".

The classic twin of example 1 carries the same two documents under its
form, and no table, having no resource to compare with. Its form requires
the title and holds the capacity between 1 and 1000, in its own code.
The config schema states the bounds only because it is written from
example 1's resource; written for the classic form alone, it would state
neither rule. Example 2's twin carries the same two documents too: its
form offers the chosen venue's rooms, refuses a room of another venue
and holds the capacity between 1 and the room's seats, in its own code,
and the config schema states only the lower bound, because it is written
from example 2's resource.

## Example 1: declare what you accept

`/surface-examples/1`

Three settings, each on one line: its name, its type, its label, and
what it allows. The operation at the top, `configure`, is how the
resource is asked for: it needs nothing, only an account that may
administer site configuration may ask, and its description is what a
tool's caller reads first. It needs no method: an operation is a method
only when its context needs more.

<!-- code: src/Resource/RegistrationStep1Resource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('registration.step1', storage: RegistrationStep1Storage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure registration (step 1)'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Sets the event title, its capacity and whether registration is open.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class RegistrationStep1Resource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('title', 'string', t('Event title'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('capacity', 'integer', t('Capacity'), default: 50)
      ->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => 1, 'max' => 1000]);
    $inputs->add('open', 'boolean', t('Registration open'), default: TRUE);
  }

}
```

That class is the whole of the form at `/surface-examples/1`, its
validation (try a capacity of 1001), and what is written: the storage it
names keeps the values in config, and checks them against the config
schema before anything is saved.

**The classic twin**, at `/surface-examples/1/classic`, is the same
three settings written as a `ConfigFormBase`, as well as core allows
today: `#config_target` reads and writes each setting with no submit
handler, and the elements' own `#required`, `#min` and `#max` are its
validation. It edits the same config object. The landing page counts
both. What the classic form cannot do is be *asked*: nothing outside it
knows what its three settings accept, which is what the panel under it
shows ([above](#without-a-resource-what-config-schema-can-say)).

<!-- code: src/Form/RegistrationStep1ClassicForm.php -->

```php
final class RegistrationStep1ClassicForm extends ConfigFormBase {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function getFormId(): string {
    return 'data_surface_examples_registration_step1_classic';
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  protected function getEditableConfigNames(): array {
    return ['data_surface_examples.registration_step1'];
  }

  /**

  public function buildForm(array $form, FormStateInterface $form_state): array {
    $form['title'] = [
      '#type' => 'textfield',
      '#title' => $this->t('Event title'),
      '#required' => TRUE,
      '#config_target' => 'data_surface_examples.registration_step1:title',
    ];
    $form['capacity'] = [

    ];
    $form['open'] = [
      '#type' => 'checkbox',
      '#title' => $this->t('Registration open'),
      '#config_target' => 'data_surface_examples.registration_step1:open',
    ];
    return parent::buildForm($form, $form_state);
  }

}
```

## Example 2: answers depend on answers

`/surface-examples/2`

A venue, and a room in it. Which rooms are on offer depends on the
venue, and how many people fit depends on the room. Each rule is one
method with `#[RefinesInput]`: it is handed the key's definition, and,
by parameter name, the value of the key it reads. Its signature is its
dependency. Declaration order is form order, so the capacity is
declared after the room it depends on.

#[Resource('registration.step2', storage: RegistrationStep2Storage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',

   */
  #[RefinesInput('room')]
  public static function roomInVenue(DataDefinitionInterface $room, string $venue): DataDefinitionInterface {
    return $room->addConstraint('RoomOfEventVenue', ['venue' => $venue]);
  }

  /**
   * No more people than the chosen room seats, said under the field.
   *
   * A room that seats no known number changes nothing: the capacity keeps
   * its lower bound and has no upper one.
   */
  #[RefinesInput('capacity')]
  public static function capacityOfRoom(DataDefinitionInterface $capacity, string $room): DataDefinitionInterface {
    $seats = Venues::seats($room);
    if ($seats !== NULL && $capacity instanceof DataDefinition) {
      $capacity->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => 1, 'max' => $seats])
        ->setDescription(t('Up to @seats for the @room.', [
          '@seats' => $seats,
          '@room' => Venues::rooms()[$room],
        ]));
    }
    return $capacity;
  }

}
```

The venues and their rooms are example 15's venue entities: the venue
declares `EventVenue` and the room `EventVenueRoom`, two constraints
whose list is the site's, and the room's refiner adds
`RoomOfEventVenue` for the venue chosen, a pure function of it. One
resolver, `EventVenueOptions`, reads all three as the enabled venues or
their rooms, under the venues' list tag, so a venue added through
example 15 is offered here at the next request, with no cache rebuild,
and a venue disabled is not. The resolver says its list is the whole of
the constraint (`exact: TRUE`), as a `Choice`'s is, so both documents
state the venues and rooms as the `oneOf` they always did and name
nothing under `checkedOnServer`: the three venues shipped are the list
the class held before, so example 2's documents are as they were, byte
for byte. The seats the capacity reads are still `Venues::seats()`: a
static refiner reads only what it watches, and cannot say what site
state it read, so a room example 15 adds is offered with no cap on the
capacity.

The example ships at Riverside Hall's main hall, so the text under the
capacity says "Up to 400 for the Main hall." Change the venue to the Old
Library: the room list rebuilds over AJAX, and so
does the panel under it, whose room row now lists the new venue's
rooms, *narrowed* from the six declared. The room saved before is not
one of them, so the room select comes up on its empty option rather
than on some other room. The saved room has not gone anywhere: Save
refuses it, since it belongs to the venue you just moved away from,
until a room of the new venue is chosen, and putting the venue back
shows it chosen again. While no room of the venue is chosen, the
capacity has its lower bound, 1, and no upper one: there are no seats
to stop at.
Choose the garden room and the capacity's row says "from 1 to 30", and
the text under the capacity field, rebuilt with it, says "Up to 30 for
the Garden room." A refiner can only tighten: the framework checks
every result is narrower than what was declared, so the panel's first
answer stays true.

**The classic twin**, at `/surface-examples/2/classic`, is the same five
settings written as a `ConfigFormBase` by hand, as well as core allows
today, as example 1's twin is: `#config_target` reads and writes each
setting, so the parent's `submitForm()` saves them. What depends on what
is written out. The venue and the room rebuild the room and the capacity
over `#ajax`; `buildForm()` reads the submitted venue and room from the
form state, and on a new venue drops the old venue's room from the input
and falls back to the stored room; `validateForm()` refuses a room of
another venue and a capacity outside 1 and the room's seats, in the words
the resource uses. It edits the same config object. It chooses from
`Venues`' fixed lists, so a venue example 15 adds is offered by example
2 and not by its twin.

Its page says what the two forms share and counts both, from the files,
the way the landing page counts every class: without the namespace, the
use statements, blank lines and comments. The twin is **94 lines of
code**; example 2's resource and its storage are **40**. The storage is
counted with the resource because the twin names its config object
itself, which the resource leaves to its storage.

The twin behaves the same at the form, and nowhere else: there is no
tool for it, no schema says what it accepts, and no React page draws it.
At the form it falls short of the module's rule for a room left behind
by a new venue in three places, said in a comment in `buildForm()`: its
select does not say it stands for the stored room, a save leaving it
empty is refused as required, and a stored room its venue no longer
offers is shown as "- Select -" rather than kept with a warning. Posted
without JavaScript, a room of another venue is refused on the room by
both forms, in different words: example 2's form lists the rooms of the
venue sent, so core's own choice check answers first, and the twin lists
those of the venue it was built for, so its `validateForm()` does.

## Example 3: made of parts

`/surface-examples/3`

Two parts, each a structure of its own. The **ticket** has *variants*:
the pricing chooses which one it is. Example 3 names neither ticket;
each ticket names example 3, with `#[Variant]`, so a third kind of
ticket is a new class and example 3 never changes. The **contact** is a
fixed part, attached with `attach()`: always there, and validated in
its own frame, so its email is checked by its own rules.

The pricing lists no values: its values are the tickets', and its
labels too, each ticket saying what it is offered as with `label:`. A
third ticket is offered as soon as its class exists. The two tickets:

<!-- code: src/Structure/FreeTicketStructure.php -->

```php

      ->setRequired(TRUE)
      ->addConstraint('Choice', ['choices' => ['EUR', 'GBP', 'USD']]);
  }

}
```

And the contact:

<!-- code: src/Structure/ContactStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('registration.contact')]
final class ContactStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**

  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('email', 'email', t('Email'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('phone', 'string', t('Phone'));
  }

}
```

Switch the pricing to paid: the ticket rebuilds with a price and a
currency, and the panel shows the paid variant's keys. A paid ticket
with no price is refused as `ticket.price`, an email that is no email as
`contact.email`.

## Example 4: others get a say

`/surface-examples/4`, which says what to do:

```bash
drush pm:install data_surface_examples_compliance
```

then reload example 3. A second module, which example 3 does not know,
changes it with three classes. One is a shape, what an event license is
wherever it is asked for: four digits, explained in words, declared
once. One is a structure, what compliance asks of any event: a license
of that shape and a number of stewards. The third is an alter of
example 3, an adapter: it attaches the structure at its own mount, so
the two keys are stored under the module's own name (at
`third_party_settings.data_surface_examples_compliance.license` and
`.stewards`, so example 3's storage never has to know them), and it
rewords the title's label. Its rules and its methods are what you see
move. A rule is data, a condition and an effect, which the served
contract writes down as it is; a static method is a pure function of
what it watches, so the served contract states its answers ahead of
time where it can; a method that reads State is a runtime refiner, the
only kind an instance method may be:

- **The license lifts a ceiling on example 3's own key.** The alter's
  rule on `capacity`, `narrow('capacity')->when(Condition::absent('license'))`,
  reads the structure's `license` at the alter's mount. With no license
  it caps the capacity at 100 and says so under the field; with one it
  leaves the capacity alone, so the room's limit, from example 3's own
  method, is what applies. Both narrow the same key, the method first
  and the rule after, and each only narrows: the lower ceiling wins. The
  full schema states the rule exactly, as an `if` that the license holds
  nothing.
- **The stewards follow the capacity.** The structure cannot name
  example 3's capacity, since it is meant for any event: it reads a
  `capacity` port, `$inputs->reads('capacity', 'integer', required:
  TRUE)`, and its method on `stewards` watches the port, one steward per
  fifty people, at least one. The alter wires the port to example 3's
  key, `reads: ['capacity' => 'capacity']`; another module attaching the
  structure would wire it to a key of its own.
- **A closed room is not offered.** The alter's method on example 3's
  `room` is a runtime refiner (`runtime: TRUE`): it reads the rooms a
  site has closed from State, which no schema can state ahead of time.
  Nothing is closed until a site says so (`drush state:set
  data_surface_examples_compliance.closed_rooms '["riverside_east"]'
  --input-format=json`); then the room leaves the East room out and says
  "The East room is closed.", the submit refuses it, and the full schema
  still lists it under Riverside Hall, marked `live`. Reset to
  defaults opens every room again.

No form alter, no hook.

    ));
  }

}
```

The two keys sit in one fieldset, titled "Compliance" by the alter,
which also places it: `after: 'capacity'` draws the fieldset right after
the capacity its license lifts, on the form and in React, instead of
last. Only where it is drawn moves; the keys are still stored and posted
at `third_party_settings.data_surface_examples_compliance`, and the Tool
API and the config schema see nothing new. In the served contract the
fieldset is the structure's def, `registration.compliance`, referred to
from the mount, which says which of example 3's keys the port reads
(`x-surface.reads`); the license inside it is the shape's def,
`event.license`, written once and referred to from the key, which says
its own title beside the reference. Example 3 ships at Riverside Hall's main hall, which
seats 400. The capacity stops at 100, and its help text says why: "Up
to 100 without an event license." The
license asks for the four digits after EV- only. Type `2048` and the
capacity goes back to the owner's "Up to 400 for the Main hall."; type
`204` or `EV-2048` and the license is refused, in the structure's words,
under the field, and the capacity stops at 100 again: a rule never
sees a value its own key refuses, so a license in the wrong format is no
license. In a room that seats 100 or fewer the license changes nothing:
the room's own ceiling is the lower one, and the owner's help text
stands, since a rule says why only where it tightened. The help text says the format before
anything is typed, and the box shows
`2048` as its placeholder: a pattern explains nothing to a person, so
the Regex carries a message, and the panel's "Allows" column says that.
Under the stewards it says "At least 1 steward for 50 attendees."; set
the capacity to 150 and it asks for "At least 3 stewards for 150
attendees." In the panel, the capacity's row now depends on `room` and
on the license's path. An alter can add and tighten. It can never take
away what the owner declared.

### Files

What example 4 is made of, as its page lists them, each with its lines
of code, counted without blank lines or comments:

## Example 5: same contract, no form

`/surface-examples/5`

Nothing to write. Example 3 names its storage and has an operation that needs
nothing, so the Tool API bridge (`data_surface_tool`) derives a tool
from it, `data_surface:registration.step3:configure`. It takes what
example 3's form takes, refuses what it refuses, with the same messages,
and can rehearse a write without making it. Beside it is a read tool,
`data_surface:registration.step3:configure:read`, which takes nothing
and answers with what is stored, in the shape the write tool takes, so
a caller can see what is there before it changes it.

The script makes three calls to the tool and prints what each answered:

```bash
ddev exec php web/modules/custom/data_surface/scripts/examples-dry-run.php
```

```
1. Valid values
Success: Configure registration (step 3): the values were accepted and written.
  ok: true
  committed: true
  changed: true
  changes: ["/title","/venue","/room","/pricing","/ticket/price","/ticket/currency","/ticket/note"]
  values: {"title":"Autumn meetup","open":true,"venue":"harbour","room":"harbour_deck","capacity":50,"pricing":"paid","ticket":{"price":12.5,"currency":"EUR"},"contact":{"email":"events@example.com","phone":""}}
  violations: []
  notes: []
  stale: []

2. A capacity above the room's
Failed: The values were refused:
/capacity: This value should be between 1 and 30. This applies when Room is library_garden (Garden room).
  ok: false
  committed: false
  changed: false
  changes: []
  values: {"title":"Garden party","open":true,"venue":"library","room":"library_garden","capacity":45,"pricing":"free","ticket":{"note":null},"contact":{"email":"events@example.com","phone":""}}
  violations: [{"path":"/capacity","code":"not_in_range","message":"This value should be between 1 and 30. This applies when Room is library_garden (Garden room)."}]
  notes: []
  stale: []

3. A dry run
Success: Dry run of Configure registration (step 3): the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  ok: true
  committed: false
  changed: false
  changes: ["/title","/venue","/room","/capacity","/pricing","/ticket/note","/ticket/price","/ticket/currency"]
  values: {"title":"Winter social","open":true,"venue":"riverside","room":"riverside_east","capacity":40,"pricing":"free","ticket":{"note":"Donations welcome"},"contact":{"email":"events@example.com","phone":""}}
  violations: []
  notes: []
  stale: []
```

`changes` is every stored value the call changed, or a dry run would:
writing back what the read tool returned answers none, and saves
nothing.

The same tool and the same three calls, from Drush, after a read of
what is stored:

```bash
drush tool:info data_surface:registration.step3:configure

drush tool:run data_surface:registration.step3:configure:read --uid=1

drush tool:run data_surface:registration.step3:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"title":"Autumn meetup","capacity":50,"venue":"harbour","room":"harbour_deck","pricing":"paid","ticket":{"price":12.5,"currency":"EUR"}}}'

drush tool:run data_surface:registration.step3:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"title":"Garden party","venue":"library","room":"library_garden","capacity":45,"pricing":"free"}}'

drush tool:run data_surface:registration.step3:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"title":"Winter social","capacity":40,"venue":"riverside","room":"riverside_east","pricing":"free","ticket":{"note":"Donations welcome"}}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

`--uid=1` because `tool:run` runs as anonymous unless told otherwise,
and the operation asks for "administer site configuration", for a read
as for a write. `tool:info` lists no defaults and requires no key:
configuring changes what exists, a key left out keeps its current value
(each key the resource requires says "Required; a value already stored
stands when left out."), and the description, after saying what the
operation sets, says the read tool, the second command, returns what
that value is. The dry run
is a second input, which `tool:run` reads as `name=value` and decodes as
JSON, so `true` is a boolean.

The script and the Drush commands exercise the same tool, through the
same pipeline, against the same resource. The difference is where they
run: the script runs the calls inside a kernel test,
`ExamplesToolTest`, on a fresh database it throws away, so it can be
run any number of times and is what the test suite verifies; the Drush
commands run against your site, and the first one writes example 3's
settings. The calls are written down once, in `ExampleCalls`, and both
are generated from it. Every call says where the event is, so none
depends on an earlier one, and every capacity is fifty or fewer, which
needs no license and one steward, the default, so example 4's module
does not change the answers. Enable it and send the first call with a
capacity of 150, which the upper deck seats, and no license to see it
refuse.

### When a call is refused

The listing names what each key depends on, once, in its description,
by the path a caller sends it under, and says nothing about what is
stored. With example 4's module enabled, `tool:info` shows, among the
`values` input's properties:

```

`tool:info` cuts a long description short; the capacity's reads in full
"Depends on room, third_party_settings.data_surface_examples_compliance.license.",
and the room's "Depends on venue. Required; a value already stored stands
when left out."

A refusal says what is allowed for the values sent, in one sentence per
key: what the key depends on, by its path, and what that holds, and for
a value not on its list, the list as it stands for them, each value to
send with its label beside it. The result carries the same refusal as
data, each violation's path, a stable code and its message, which the
agent reads instead of the text. An agent fixes each key in one retry. `ToolFeedbackTest` plays
that loop as a dry run through the Tool API's runner, the way MCP and
ECA call a tool: the agent sends the venue by name; then moves the
event to a room of another venue; then doubles the capacity to 240,
leaving the stewards at three. The three refusals:

```
Failed: The values were refused:
/venue: The value you selected is not a valid choice. Choose riverside (Riverside Hall), library (Old Library) or harbour (Harbour Centre).
Failed: The values were refused:
/room: The value you selected is not a valid choice. This applies when Venue is riverside (Riverside Hall). Choose riverside_main (Main hall) or riverside_east (East room).
Failed: The values were refused:
/third_party_settings/data_surface_examples_compliance/stewards: This value should be 5 or more. This applies when Capacity is 240.
```

Each time the agent reads the fix from the refusal alone and the next
call is accepted. The Tool API holds `values` to its shape before the
tool runs (types, the keys it requires, its nesting) and the pipeline
holds it to every rule, against the definitions the values sent narrow,
so a value outside the listing's list is answered with the list that
applies rather than refused with none
([decision](../../docs/decisions.md#a-refusal-names-what-it-depends-on)).

### Files

Example 5 adds no file of its own: it is made from the files of
example 3.

## In React

Examples 1 to 3 again, with no Form API: the same operation served as a
JSON contract and rendered by a React app, from the experimental
submodule `data_surface_react`.

```bash
drush pm:install data_surface_react
```

The landing page then links each example "In React":
`/surface-react/registration.step1/configure`,
`/surface-react/registration.step2/configure` and
`/surface-react/registration.step3/configure`. Each is the same resource
as the form beside it, read from `/surface-api/registration.stepN`:
JSON Schema with the labels as `oneOf` titles, the bounds as `minimum`
and `maximum`, the ticket variants as a conditional on the pricing, and an
`x-surface` note on every key saying what the form knows about it.

Change the venue on example 2: the app narrows the room and the
capacity itself from the full schema, as the form's AJAX rebuild does,
and asks the server (`POST /surface-api/registration.step2/schema`)
only for a rule the schema cannot state; the room comes back on its
empty option, standing for the stored room, which stays on the server.
Press Submit to save: the answers go to
`PATCH /surface-api/registration.step2`, which writes what the form's
Save writes, refuses what it refuses (a 422, each refusal beside its
field and in a summary, with nothing written), and answers with the
contract as now stored, which the app re-renders from. If someone saved
the example since the page loaded, the write is refused (a 412: the
`If-Match` the app sends no longer matches) rather than overwriting
them. The collapsed Contract panel under the form is the
contract as it stands.
[The served contract](../../docs/served-contract.md) has the format.

## Example 6: every door

The same contract through every door. The decoupled page is the one
above, [In React](#in-react): the contract served as JSON and drawn by a
React app. ECA and an AI agent, through the tool of example 5, are yours
to show on your own site. With `data_surface_openapi` enabled, the
landing page links `/surface-api/openapi.json`, every example's paths
described for any OpenAPI client, and `/surface-api/docs`, Swagger UI
over it, to try each call with your session.

### Files

Example 6 adds no file of its own: it is made from the files of
example 3.

## One small resource per concept

Examples 7 to 12 leave the registration behind. Each is a small
resource of its own, for one or two concepts the registration form does
not need, served the way examples 1 to 3 are: the generic operation form,
the contract panel and what config schema can say. Above them, open, a
third panel says what the example shows, where the docs explain it, the
part of its documents the concept is about, and what its tool answers.
Those calls are written down once, in `ConceptCalls`; none of them writes
anything, so the panel makes them each time it is drawn, and
`ExamplesConceptsToolTest` makes them on the shipped settings and holds
this page to their answers.

## Example 7: a rule written as data

`/surface-examples/7`

The event's bulletin goes out weekly or monthly. Two rules read the
frequency, and each is a condition and an effect, declared beside the
keys with `narrow()->when()`: a weekly issue holds at most five items,
and a monthly bulletin has no send day. The send day is declared
required, as it is wherever it applies; the rule says where it does not
([Declaring a rule](../../docs/refinement.md#declaring-a-rule),
[When a key does not apply](../../docs/refinement.md#when-a-key-does-not-apply)).

<!-- code: src/Resource/BulletinResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.bulletin', storage: BulletinStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure the bulletin'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Sets how often the event bulletin goes out, the day it is sent and how many items an issue holds.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class BulletinResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('frequency', 'string', t('Frequency'), default: 'weekly')
      ->setRequired(TRUE)
      ->addConstraint('LabeledChoice', [
        'choices' => ['weekly' => t('Weekly'), 'monthly' => t('Monthly')],
      ]);
    $inputs->add('send_day', 'string', t('Send day'), default: 'monday')
      ->setRequired(TRUE)
      ->addConstraint('LabeledChoice', [
        'choices' => ['monday' => t('Monday'), 'wednesday' => t('Wednesday'), 'friday' => t('Friday')],
      ]);
    $inputs->add('items', 'integer', t('Items per issue'), default: 5)
      ->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => 1, 'max' => 20]);

    $inputs->narrow('send_day')
      ->when(Condition::equals('frequency', 'monthly'))
      ->doesNotApply();
    $inputs->narrow('items')
      ->when(Condition::equals('frequency', 'weekly'))
      ->constrain('Range', ['max' => 5])
      ->because(t('Up to 5 in a weekly issue.'));
  }

}
```

Nothing is run to learn either rule. The full schema states each as
written, an `if`/`then` the frame lists in `x-surface.rules`, and the
send day as `false` under the monthly conditional and `required` under
the other: the panel shows the rules beside those three conditionals.
Choose
Monthly and the send day is gone from the form, over AJAX; the stored
Friday is kept for the day the bulletin goes weekly again: the third
call's values leave it out, as every answer leaves out a key that does
not apply, and storage still holds it. Choose Weekly and the items stop at five,
said under the field: "Up to 5 in a weekly issue."

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.bulletin:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"frequency":"monthly","send_day":"monday"}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.bulletin:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"frequency":"weekly","items":8}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.bulletin:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"frequency":"monthly","items":8}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
1. A send day for a monthly bulletin
Failed: The values were refused:
/send_day: Send day does not apply when Frequency is monthly (Monthly).

2. Eight items in a weekly issue
Failed: The values were refused:
/items: This value should be between 1 and 5. This applies when Frequency is weekly (Weekly).

3. Eight items in a monthly issue, and no send day
Success: Dry run of Configure the bulletin: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"frequency":"monthly","items":8}
```

## Example 8: one part, used twice

`/surface-examples/8`, and `/surface-examples/8/desk`

A person to contact is one structure, attached by two resources, the
press page and the information desk. Whether the person is listed
publicly is the container's to know, so the structure reads it through
a port, `listed`, and asks for an email while it holds. Each container
wires the port to a key of its own
([Ports](../../docs/resources.md#ports)). The phone is a named shape,
asked for by the person and by the desk itself
([Named shapes](../../docs/declaring-a-resource.md#named-shapes)).

<!-- code: src/Structure/PersonStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.person')]
final class PersonStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->reads('listed', 'boolean');
    $inputs->add('name', 'string', t('Name'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('email', 'email', t('Email'));
    $inputs->add('phone', PhoneNumber::class, t('Phone'));
    $inputs->narrow('email')
      ->when(Condition::equals('listed', TRUE))
      ->require()
      ->because(t('Required while this person is listed publicly.'));
  }

}
```

<!-- code: src/Shape/PhoneNumber.php -->

```php
#[Shape('event.phone')]
final class PhoneNumber implements ShapeInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function define(): DataDefinition {
    $phone = DataDefinition::create('string')
      ->setLabel(t('Phone'))
      ->setDescription(t('Digits, with spaces if you like, and a leading + for a country code.'))
      ->addConstraint('Regex', [
        'pattern' => '/^\+?[0-9 ]{7,20}$/D',
        'message' => t('Write the number in digits, such as +1 555 0100.'),
      ]);
    DefinitionMetadata::setExamples($phone, ['+1 555 0100']);
    return $phone;
  }

}
```

The press page wires the port to `public`, and mixes the review in, so
the review's two keys are the page's own: stored flat beside `public`,
drawn among its keys, and named in a refusal as `reviewed_by`, not under
a parent ([Mixins](../../docs/resources.md#mixins)).

<!-- code: src/Structure/ReviewStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.review')]
final class ReviewStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('reviewed_on', 'string', t('Reviewed on'))
      ->setDescription(t('YYYY-MM-DD.'))
      ->addConstraint('Regex', [
        'pattern' => '/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/D',
        'message' => t('Write the date as YYYY-MM-DD, such as 2026-10-19.'),
      ]);
    $inputs->add('reviewed_by', 'string', t('Reviewed by'));
    $inputs->narrow('reviewed_by')
      ->when(Condition::present('reviewed_on'))
      ->require()
      ->because(t('Required once a review date is set.'));
  }

}
```

<!-- code: src/Resource/PressResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.press', storage: PressStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure the press page'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Sets the press page: whether it is shown, the press contact, and who last reviewed it and when.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class PressResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('public', 'boolean', t('Show on the press page'), default: TRUE);
    $inputs->attach('contact', PersonStructure::class, reads: ['listed' => 'public'])
      ->setLabel(t('Press contact'));
    $inputs->mixIn(ReviewStructure::class);
  }

}
```

The desk wires the port to `in_program`, and holds a collection, up to
four volunteers, each a person in its own frame, added and removed on
the form over AJAX. A collection's item is wired by nothing, so a
volunteer is never asked for an email
([Collections](../../docs/resources.md#collections)).

<!-- code: src/Resource/InfoDeskResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.desk', storage: InfoDeskStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure the information desk'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Sets the information desk: its phone, whether it is listed in the printed program, its lead and up to four volunteers.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class InfoDeskResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('phone', PhoneNumber::class, t('Desk phone'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('in_program', 'boolean', t('Listed in the printed program'), default: FALSE);
    $inputs->attach('lead', PersonStructure::class, reads: ['listed' => 'in_program'])
      ->setLabel(t('Desk lead'));
    $inputs->attachList('volunteers', PersonStructure::class, max: 4)
      ->setLabel(t('Volunteers'));
  }

}
```

Both documents write the person once, as the def `event.person`, which
names no container and lists its port; each site refers to it, says
which key the port reads (`x-surface.reads`), and states the email rule
on the container, where that key is. The phone is the def `event.phone`
in both, and the review the def `event.review`, which the press page's
top refers to from its `allOf`. The panel shows the two sites side by
side and what each class costs.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.press:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"public":true,"contact":{"name":"Robin Lee","email":null}}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.press:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"public":false,"contact":{"name":"Robin Lee","email":null}}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.press:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"reviewed_on":"2026-10-19","reviewed_by":null}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
1. A public contact with the email cleared
Failed: The values were refused:
/contact/email: Email is required when Show on the press page is on.

2. The same contact, not shown on the press page
Success: Dry run of Configure the press page: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"public":false,"contact":{"name":"Robin Lee","email":null,"phone":"+1 555 0100"},"reviewed_on":"2026-10-01","reviewed_by":"Sam Ortiz"}

3. A review date with no reviewer

## Example 9: keys that come from the site

`/surface-examples/9`

One checkbox and one set of limits per ticket type the site sells. The
class cannot list the ticket types: the site's configuration does, in
`data_surface_examples.ticket_types`, and a provider reads it
([Keys that come from the site](../../docs/resources.md#keys-that-come-from-the-site)).

<!-- code: src/Resource/TicketSalesResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.sales', storage: TicketSalesStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure ticket sales'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Sets which ticket types are on sale, and for each how many tickets one order may hold and whether a waiting list opens when it sells out.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class TicketSalesResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->addEach('on_sale', 'boolean', from: TicketTypes::class, default: FALSE)
      ->setLabel(t('On sale'))
      ->setDescription(t('Which ticket types can be bought.'));
    $inputs->attachEach('limits', TicketLimitStructure::class, from: TicketTypes::class, reads: ['selling' => 'on_sale'])
      ->setLabel(t('Limits'));
  }

}
```

Each type's limits read whether that type is on sale. The structure
declares a port, `selling`, and rules its keys out while it is off;
`reads: ['selling' => 'on_sale']` wires the port of the entry `<type>`
to `on_sale.<type>`, the entry of the same id in the sibling map
([Ports on an entry](../../docs/resources.md#ports-on-an-entry)).

<!-- code: src/Structure/TicketLimitStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.ticket_limit')]
final class TicketLimitStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('per_order', 'integer', t('Per order'), default: 4)
      ->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => 1, 'max' => 10]);
    $inputs->add('waiting_list', 'boolean', t('Waiting list when sold out'), default: FALSE);
    $inputs->reads('selling', 'boolean');
    $inputs->narrow('per_order')->when(Condition::equals('selling', FALSE))->doesNotApply();
    $inputs->narrow('waiting_list')->when(Condition::equals('selling', FALSE))->doesNotApply();
  }

}
```

Untick a type and its limits go: the form drops their elements over
AJAX, and the page drops their fields with no request. Tick it again and
they return as stored, since storage keeps what a key holds while it does
not apply. The full schema states the rule once per type, on the
resource's frame, an `if` on the type's checkbox and a `then` reaching
into its limits:

```json
{
    "if": {
        "properties": {
            "on_sale": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "student": {
                        "const": false
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "student"
                ]
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "on_sale"
        ]
    },
    "then": {
        "properties": {
            "limits": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "student": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "per_order": false
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<!-- code: src/Keys/TicketTypes.php -->

```php
final class TicketTypes implements KeysFromSiteInterface, ContainerInjectionInterface {

  /**
   * The configuration object the ticket types are listed in.
   */
  public const CONFIG = 'data_surface_examples.ticket_types';

  /**
   * Constructs the provider.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Config\ConfigFactoryInterface $configFactory
   *   The configuration factory.
   */
  public function __construct(
    protected readonly ConfigFactoryInterface $configFactory,
  ) {}

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function create(ContainerInterface $container): static {
    return new static($container->get('config.factory'));
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function keys(): KeyedList {
    $config = $this->configFactory->get(self::CONFIG);
    $keys = (new KeyedList())->addCacheableDependency($config);
    foreach ($config->get('types') ?? [] as $id => $type) {
      $keys->add((string) $id, (string) $type['label'], locked: (bool) ($type['locked'] ?? FALSE));
    }
    return $keys;
  }

}
```

The provider declares what it read, the configuration's cache tag, so
the built resource, the form, both documents and the tool listing are
cached by it. Add a type and reload, with no cache rebuild:

```bash
drush config:set data_surface_examples.ticket_types types.vip '{label: VIP, locked: false}' --input-format=yaml
drush config:delete data_surface_examples.ticket_types types.vip
```

The form has a VIP checkbox and VIP limits at once; the second command
takes them away again. The speaker type is locked in the configuration:
its checkbox is drawn fixed, `readOnly` in both documents, and a value a
tool sends for it is not taken, which the answer says in a note. It is
not on sale as shipped, so its limits do not apply and are not drawn;
put on sale, they are drawn fixed too. The panel shows the keys the provider answered, its cache tag,
one type's rules as the full schema states them, and the locked type in
both documents. A limit sent for a type off sale is refused, naming the
checkbox it depends on.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.sales:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"on_sale":{"standard":true,"speaker":true}}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.sales:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"on_sale":{"student":false},"limits":{"student":{"per_order":2}}}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
1. Speaker tickets put on sale
Success: Dry run of Configure ticket sales: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
/on_sale/speaker: Speaker is locked and kept as stored; the value sent was not taken.
  values: {"on_sale":{"standard":true,"student":true,"speaker":false},"limits":{"standard":{"per_order":4,"waiting_list":false},"student":{"per_order":1,"waiting_list":true},"speaker":[]}}

2. Student tickets taken off sale, with a new limit for them
Failed: The values were refused:
/limits/student/per_order: Per order does not apply when On sale: Student is off.
```

## Example 10: who may change what

`/surface-examples/10`, and `/surface-examples/10/check`

The program's fees are a structure whose access class answers whether
they may be changed. Its answer's kind is read from its cacheability,
never declared
([Static and runtime access](../../docs/resources.md#static-and-runtime-access)):

- **Static**, for an account without "set event fees", the module's
  permission: the fees are locked, read from the account's permissions
  alone, so the full schema and the tool listing state the lock for that
  account.
- **Runtime**, for any other account: once the program is published the
  fees are fixed, which only what is stored says, read under the
  program's config tag. The full schema marks the fees `access:
  "live"`, and the schema for these answers, the form and the
  pipeline settle it. Save the program published and reload: the fees
  are drawn disabled.

<!-- code: src/Access/FeesAccess.php -->

```php
final class FeesAccess implements OperationAccessInterface {

  /**
   * The permission that may change the fees.
   */
  public const PERMISSION = 'set event fees';

  /**
   * Constructs the access class, which the container builds as a service.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Config\ConfigFactoryInterface $configFactory
   *   The configuration factory, for the program's stored status.
   */
  public function __construct(
    protected readonly ConfigFactoryInterface $configFactory,
  ) {}

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function access(OperationContext $context, AccountInterface $account): AccessAnswer {
    $read = (new CacheableMetadata())->addCacheContexts(['user.permissions']);
    if (!$account->hasPermission(self::PERMISSION)) {
      // Static: the account alone.
      return AccessAnswer::locked('Only an account that may set event fees changes them.')->addCacheableDependency($read);
    }
    $program = $this->configFactory->get(ProgramStorage::CONFIG);
    $read->addCacheableDependency($program);
    if ($program->get('published') === TRUE) {
      // Runtime: a stored value, under its config tag.
      return AccessAnswer::locked('The fees are fixed once the program is published.')->addCacheableDependency($read);
    }
    return AccessAnswer::open()->addCacheableDependency($read);
  }

}
```

<!-- code: src/Structure/FeesStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.fees', access: FeesAccess::class)]
final class FeesStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('standard', 'float', t('Standard fee'), default: 20.0)
      ->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => 0]);
    $inputs->add('concession', 'float', t('Concession fee'), default: 10.0)
      ->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => 0]);
  }

}
```

<!-- code: src/Resource/ProgramResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.program', storage: ProgramStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure the program'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Sets the program: its headline, how many sessions it has, whether it is published, and its fees.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
#[Operation('check',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Check a program'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Checks a program against every rule the program configuration applies, and saves nothing.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
  readOnly: TRUE,
)]
final class ProgramResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('headline', 'string', t('Headline'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('sessions', 'integer', t('Sessions'), default: 8)
      ->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => 1, 'max' => 30]);
    $inputs->add('published', 'boolean', t('Published'), default: FALSE);
    $inputs->attach('fees', FeesStructure::class)
      ->setLabel(t('Fees'));
  }

}
```

Each operation also states how a call behaves
([An operation states how it behaves](../../docs/decisions.md#an-operation-states-how-it-behaves)).
Configuring changes what exists and may be repeated; checking changes
nothing, `readOnly: TRUE`, so its form at `/surface-examples/10/check`
and its tool accept and validate and write nothing, and it has no read
tool beside it. Both documents state the facts under
`x-surface.operation`. The panel shows the fees' part of the full schema
for you and for an account without the permission, and a table of the
two operations: their facts, the Tool API kind each tool is given, and
the hints an MCP client reads from that kind. Configuring reaches an MCP
client as not idempotent: the Tool API has idempotence on the kind, and
no kind that writes is idempotent.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.program:check --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"headline":"Three days of talks","sessions":12}}'

drush tool:run data_surface:event.program:check --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"headline":"Three days of talks","sessions":40}}'
```

```
1. A program checked
Success: Check a program changes nothing: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"headline":"Three days of talks","sessions":12,"published":false,"fees":{"standard":20.0,"concession":10.0}}

2. A program with too many sessions, checked
Failed: The values were refused:
/sessions: This value should be between 1 and 30.
```

### Another module answers too

```bash
drush pm:install data_surface_examples_workflow
```

then reload example 10. A second module, which example 10 does not
know, answers access for the program and its fees with two alters,
each implementing `AltersAccessInterface`. Its answers are asked after
the program's own (the operation's permission, then the fees' access
class), and the stricter answer stands, so it can lock or leave out
and can never open what the fees' own access locked
([An alter's answer](../../docs/resources.md#an-alters-answer)). Each
answer's kind is read from its cacheability, as any answer's is:

- **Static**, for an account without "see event fees", the module's
  permission: the fees are left out, read from the account's
  permissions alone, so the full schema and the tool listing for that
  account have no fees at all, where before they were locked.
- **Runtime**, once the module's workflow state, which it keeps in
  State, is published: the program is locked whole in the operation
  that changes it, its headline and its fees with every other key, and
  the fees are fixed wherever else they appear. Only what is stored
  says so, so the full schema marks every key of the program `access:
  "live"`, and a call is refused by name.

<!-- code: ../data_surface_examples_workflow/src/Alter/FeesWorkflowAlter.php -->

```php
#[Alters(FeesStructure::class)]
final class FeesWorkflowAlter implements AltersAccessInterface {

  /**
   * The permission that may see the fees.
   */
  public const PERMISSION = 'see event fees';

  /**
   * Constructs the alter, which the container builds as a service.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\State\StateInterface $state
   *   The State, where the workflow state is kept.
   */
  public function __construct(
    protected readonly StateInterface $state,
  ) {}

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function access(OperationContext $context, AccountInterface $account): AccessAnswer {
    $read = (new CacheableMetadata())->addCacheContexts(['user.permissions']);
    if (!$account->hasPermission(self::PERMISSION)) {
      // Static: the account alone.
      return AccessAnswer::omitted('Only an account that may see event fees sees them.')->addCacheableDependency($read);
    }
    // Runtime: a stored value, read now.
    $read->setCacheMaxAge(0);
    if ($this->state->get(ProgramWorkflowAlter::STATE) === ProgramWorkflowAlter::PUBLISHED) {
      return AccessAnswer::locked('The fees are fixed once the program is published in its workflow.')->addCacheableDependency($read);
    }
    return AccessAnswer::open()->addCacheableDependency($read);
  }

}
```

<!-- code: ../data_surface_examples_workflow/src/Alter/ProgramWorkflowAlter.php -->

```php
#[Alters(ProgramResource::class, operations: ['configure'])]
final class ProgramWorkflowAlter implements AltersAccessInterface {

  /**
   * The State key holding the program's workflow state.
   */
  public const STATE = 'data_surface_examples_workflow.state';

  /**
   * The workflow state that fixes the program.
   */
  public const PUBLISHED = 'published';

  /**
   * Constructs the alter, which the container builds as a service.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\State\StateInterface $state
   *   The State, where the workflow state is kept.
   */
  public function __construct(
    protected readonly StateInterface $state,
  ) {}

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function access(OperationContext $context, AccountInterface $account): AccessAnswer {
    $answer = $this->state->get(self::STATE) === self::PUBLISHED
      ? AccessAnswer::locked('The program is published in its workflow, so it is fixed.')
      : AccessAnswer::open();
    // Runtime: a stored value, read now.
    return $answer->mergeCacheMaxAge(0);
  }

}
```

The panel above the form then says what the module answers, and its
last call is made with the workflow state published, set for the call
and put back after it:

```bash
drush state:set data_surface_examples_workflow.state published
drush tool:run data_surface:event.program:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"headline":"Four days of talks"}}' --input=dry_run=true
drush state:delete data_surface_examples_workflow.state
```

```
3. A new headline, once the workflow module has published the program
Failed: The values were refused:
This may be seen and not changed, so nothing was written: The program is published in its workflow, so it is fixed.
```

Neither the program nor the fees changed, and Reset to defaults clears
the workflow state.

## Example 11: the stock widgets, and what nothing means

`/surface-examples/11`

The live companion of [Common settings recipes](../../docs/recipes.md):
every stock widget, each chosen by what its key declares. A time input
for a string that asks for one; checkboxes for a list of three choices;
radios for one choice that asks for them; a text area for a multiline
string; and rows with "Add another" for a list of free values
([Widgets](../../docs/widgets.md#the-stock-widgets)).

      ]);

      ->setSetting('multiline', TRUE);

    $inputs->addList('greeters', 'string', t('Greeters'), default: []);
  }

}
```

The config schema is written from the resource, so it is fully
validatable ([A schema generated from the
resource](../../docs/storage.md#a-schema-generated-from-the-resource)):
`FullyValidatable` at its root, every key stored, and `nullable: true`
on the notes alone, the one single value with no default. So the storage
knows the notes may hold nothing and the badges may not: the badges are always held, their radios offer no
"- None -", and both schemas leave `null` out of their type.

What a call sends for a key means one of three things
([Absent, null, or a value](../../docs/semantics.md#absent-null-or-a-value)):
left out, the key keeps what is stored; `null`, it is cleared; a value
replaces it. The four dry runs show each, and the fourth what null does
to a key the storage always holds: it is refused, naming the default.
The panel shows them, and a table of each key's widget and type.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.doors:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"opens":"19:00","days":["fri"]}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.doors:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"opens":"19:00","days":["fri"],"notes":null}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.doors:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"opens":"19:00","days":["fri"],"badges":null}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```

3. The notes sent a value: replaced
Success: Dry run of Configure the doors: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"opens":"19:00","days":["fri"],"badges":"printed","notes":"Doors close at ten.","greeters":["Ana","Ben"]}

4. The badges sent null: refused, since they are always held
Failed: The values were refused:

## Example 12: a schema read into a structure

`/surface-examples/12`

A component chosen from the single-directory components the site has,
and below it the props that component takes and its slots. The class
lists none of them: each component says what props it takes, in the JSON
Schema of its `*.component.yml`, and a provider hands each schema to the
reader, which writes it into a structure
([Reading a schema](../../docs/reading-a-schema.md)); its slots are in
the same file, and a second provider writes them as a schema too. The
components are variants at `props` and again at `slots`, which the
component chooses between, one per component the site has
([Variants from the site](../../docs/resources.md#variants-from-the-site)).

<!-- code: src/Resource/SpotlightResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.spotlight', storage: SpotlightStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure the spotlight'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup('Sets the component the event home page spotlights, chosen from the components the site has, and the props it is drawn with.'),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class SpotlightResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('component', 'string', t('Component'), default: 'data_surface_examples:card')
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->attachVariants('props', by: 'component', from: ComponentProps::class)
      ->setLabel(t('Props'));
    $inputs->attachVariants('slots', by: 'component', from: ComponentSlots::class)
      ->setLabel(t('Slots'));
  }

}
```

The provider lists every component, the four this module ships among
them, each by its id and its name, with its props as the component
declares them. A prop typed by a PHP class takes a value only Twig code
passes, which nothing stores: that type is left out, as the reader would
refuse it. It is the main module's, not this module's, since example 13's
block reads the components through it too.

<!-- code: ../../src/Variants/ComponentProps.php -->

```php
final class ComponentProps implements VariantsFromSiteInterface, ContainerInjectionInterface {

  /**
   * The JSON Schema types; a component may also name a PHP class.

   *
   * @return array

   */

    $props += ['type' => 'object', 'properties' => []];
    foreach ($props['properties'] as $name => $prop) {
      $types = (array) ($prop['type'] ?? []);
      $json = array_values(array_intersect($types, self::JSON_TYPES));
      if (count($json) === count($types)) {
        continue;
      }
      if ($json === []) {
        unset($props['properties'][$name]);
        $props['required'] = array_values(array_diff($props['required'] ?? [], [$name]));
        continue;
      }
      $props['properties'][$name]['type'] = $json;
    }
    $props['additionalProperties'] = FALSE;
    return $props;
  }

}
```

Its sibling, [`ComponentSlots`](../../src/Variants/ComponentSlots.php),
lists the same components, each with the object of its slots: one key
per slot its metadata declares, and none for a component with no slot.
Each slot holds one of three things, chosen by a `kind` key: `text`, a
plain string; `component`, one nested component, its `component`, its
`props` and its own `slots`, the same keys again; or `components`, a list
of those. What a slot's metadata expects narrows it, as a refusal: the
components it names under `expected`, by id or by a tag a component lists
under `tags`, and no component for an empty list; `minItems` and
`maxItems` bound the list, and a `maxItems` of 1 leaves no list. Slots
nest three deep, and a slot at that depth holds text alone
([A slot holds text, a component, or
components](../../docs/decisions.md#a-slot-holds-text-a-component-or-components)).

The module ships four components, so the page holds something whatever
the site's themes provide: a card, a hero, a call to action and a
section, with props of every type, lists of values, bounds, required
props, a nested object and an array between them, and a slot each but
the call to action. The card, as it declares itself:

<!-- component: components/card/card.component.yml -->

```yaml
$schema: https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/raw/HEAD/core/assets/schemas/v1/metadata.schema.json
name: Card
status: stable
description: 'A heading, a line of text and a link. Example 12 reads its props into a structure, and its slot beside them.'
tags:
  - block
props:
  type: object
  required:
    - heading
  properties:
    heading:
      type: string
      title: Heading
      maxLength: 80
    tone:
      type: string
      title: Tone
      enum:
        - plain
        - highlight
      meta:enum:
        plain: Plain
        highlight: Highlighted
      default: plain
    link:
      type: object
      title: Link
      properties:
        url:
          type: string
          format: uri
          title: Address
        label:
          type: ['string', 'null']
          title: Link text
slots:
  body:
    title: Text
    description: 'A line under the heading.'
    # No component: the slot holds text alone.
    expected: []
```

Read, each prop is a key. The heading is a required string of up to 80
characters, the tone a choice of Plain and Highlighted, labeled by `meta:enum` and starting from plain,
and the link a map whose address is a URI. The page shows the card's
schema beside the def it became in the full schema, what the reader
noted (the link is an object that leaves `additionalProperties` out,
read closed), and the variants as the full schema states them, one
conditional per component:

```json
"props": {
  "title": "Props",
  "anyOf": [..., {"$ref": "#/$defs/event.spotlight.props.data_surface_examples:card"}, ...],
  "x-surface": {"dependsOn": ["component"], "by": "component",
                "variants": {..., "data_surface_examples:card": "#/$defs/event.spotlight.props.data_surface_examples:card", ...}}
},
...
"allOf": [
  ...,
  {"if": {"properties": {"component": {"const": "data_surface_examples:card"}}, "required": ["component"]},
   "then": {"properties": {"props": {"title": "Props", "$ref": "#/$defs/event.spotlight.props.data_surface_examples:card"}}}},
  ...
]
```

The card's text is its `body` slot, which expects no component, so it
holds text alone. The hero's `actions` slot expects the call to action,
two at most, and the section's `content` slot any component tagged
`block`, which the card and the hero are:

```yaml
# hero.component.yml
slots:
  actions:
    title: Actions
    description: 'Up to two buttons under the title.'
    expected:
      - 'data_surface_examples:call_to_action'
    maxItems: 2

# section.component.yml
slots:
  content:
    title: Content
    description: 'The components the section holds.'
    expected:
      - block
```

The full schema states the slots as it states the props, one conditional
per component, each slot a def of its own: the hero's actions offer
text, one component or a list of two at most, and the component they
hold offers the call to action alone.

```json
"component.slot.data_surface_examples:hero.actions.1": {
  "properties": {
    "kind": {"title": "Holds", "type": "string", "oneOf": [{"const": "text", ...}, {"const": "component", ...}, {"const": "components", ...}], "default": "text"},
    "text": {"title": "Text", "type": ["string", "null"]},
    "component": {"title": "Component", "$ref": "#/$defs/component.nested.data_surface_examples:call_to_action.1"},
    "components": {"title": "Components", "type": "array", "maxItems": 2,
                   "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/component.nested.data_surface_examples:call_to_action.1"}}
  },
  "allOf": [{"if": {"not": {"properties": {"kind": {"const": "text"}}, "required": ["kind"]}},
             "then": {"properties": {"text": false}}}, ...]
},
"component.nested.data_surface_examples:call_to_action.1": {
  "properties": {
    "component": {"title": "Component", "type": "string", "oneOf": [{"const": "data_surface_examples:call_to_action", "title": "Call to action"}]},
    "props": {"anyOf": [{"$ref": "#/$defs/component.props.data_surface_examples:call_to_action"}, ...], "x-surface": {"by": "component", ...}},
    "slots": {"anyOf": [{"$ref": "#/$defs/component.slots.data_surface_examples:call_to_action.2"}, ...], "x-surface": {"by": "component", ...}}
  },
  "required": ["component"]
}
```

Choose another component and the props below it are that component's:
the form rebuilds them over AJAX, and the React page draws them with no
request, since the full schema states every component's def. The card's
def read back is the card again, byte for byte, as every document of
these examples a runtime refiner does not narrow reads back to itself
([the round trip](../../docs/reading-a-schema.md#the-round-trip)).

The config object holds the component's id, its props and its slots.
Its config schema is written from the resource, and the props and the
slots are `type: ignore` there: which components a site has is the
site's, so no schema written once can name their props or slots, and the
variant the component chooses holds them to its keys before anything is
written. The resource, its two providers and its storage are the code;
the components' schemas and metadata are none.

A tool that sends one component's props for another is refused, naming
the component they belong to; one that sends a hero darker than its
schema allows is refused by the bound the schema states.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.spotlight:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"component":"data_surface_examples:hero","props":{"title":"Doors open at half past six","align":"start"}}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.spotlight:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"component":"data_surface_examples:card","props":{"align":"start","overlay":60}}}' --input=dry_run=true

drush tool:run data_surface:event.spotlight:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"component":"data_surface_examples:hero","props":{"title":"Doors open at half past six","overlay":140}}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
1. The hero, with props it takes
Success: Dry run of Configure the spotlight: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"component":"data_surface_examples:hero","props":{"title":"Doors open at half past six","subtitle":null,"align":"start","overlay":40,"full_width":false},"slots":{"actions":{"kind":"text","text":null}}}

2. A card sent the props of a hero
Failed: The values were refused:
/props/align: props.align belongs to the data_surface_examples:hero variant, but component chose data_surface_examples:card.
/props/overlay: props.overlay belongs to the data_surface_examples:hero variant, but component chose data_surface_examples:card.

3. A hero darker than its schema allows
Failed: The values were refused:
/props/overlay: This value should be between 0 and 100.
```

## Example 13: a block that embeds a component

`/surface-examples/13`

Example 12's three lines are the settings of a block. The block plugin
names a structure with `#[UsesStructure]` and renders; its settings
form, their validation and their storage (the block's settings) come
from the structure, through the block host
([Plugins](../../docs/resources.md#plugins)). The block lives in a
submodule of its own, `data_surface_component_block`, and a placed
block, of this plugin or any other, is placed, configured and removed
through the placement resource of `data_surface_block`, the general
case. The examples depend on neither, so the page says how to enable
both while they are off:

```bash
ddev drush pm:install data_surface_component_block data_surface_block
```

The structure is example 12's three lines under the block's id, from the
same providers:

<!-- code: ../data_surface_component_block/src/Structure/ComponentBlockStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('block.data_surface_component')]
final class ComponentBlockStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('component', 'string', t('Component'));
    $inputs->attachVariants('props', by: 'component', from: ComponentProps::class)
      ->setLabel(t('Props'));
    $inputs->attachVariants('slots', by: 'component', from: ComponentSlots::class)
      ->setLabel(t('Slots'));
  }

}
```

One difference: the component is not required. The block host builds
the block from the declared defaults before anything is chosen, the
block form and the block listing among the places that do, and no
component is one every site has to start from; a block with no
component renders nothing. The plugin renders the component it holds
with its props, less a prop that holds nothing, which core's check of
the props refuses for a prop that may not be null; a component the site
no longer has renders nothing too. Each slot renders what it holds: text
as a plain string, escaped where the slot prints it; one component as its
own render array, its props held and its slots filled the same way; a
list as each of those. A slot that holds nothing is not passed, so the
component prints nothing there. The block names the extension that
provides each component it embeds, at any depth, as a dependency, so the
block goes with any of them:

<!-- code: ../data_surface_component_block/src/Plugin/Block/ComponentBlock.php -->

```php
#[Block(
  id: self::ID,
  admin_label: new TranslatableMarkup('Component'),

Place it through the block layout, `/admin/structure/block`: "Place
block", then "Component". Choose a component and its props are drawn
below it over AJAX, read from its schema; choose another and they are
that component's. Without JavaScript the props are drawn for what is
stored, so a component whose props require something is refused on the
first save, and its props are there on the block's form once it is
saved ([A plugin host cannot overlay a full
submission](../../docs/decisions.md#a-plugin-host-cannot-overlay-a-full-submission)).

With all three modules on, whichever came last places two blocks
through the placement resource's create operation, with the values of the
first two calls below, each in the default theme's content region and
shown on `/surface-examples/13` alone, below what the page says:
Spotlight, `data_surface_examples_spotlight`, the card as example 12
ships it, a line of text in its slot; and Tonight,
`data_surface_examples_section`, a section whose slot holds a card,
whose own slot holds a line of text.

The page shows the block's three lines beside example 12's, the block
structure's full schema cut to the four components this module ships
(the same variants as example 12's, under the block's id), the hero's
actions slot as the full schema narrows it, the four tools a placed
block has, a link to place one, and what it cost.

A plugin's structure is held by its host and is no tool. A placed block
is a config entity, `block.block.<id>`, with a machine name and storage
of its own, and `data_surface_block` declares it as a resource,
`block.placement`, whose plugin chooses its settings: for this plugin,
the block's structure, as declared; for any other, what its config schema
says ([its README](../data_surface_block/README.md)). The five calls
below place the Spotlight and Tonight blocks, change the Spotlight block
to the hero, send a hero where the hero's actions expect a call to
action, and remove the Spotlight block, each as a dry run, on a site whose default theme is Stark, where the
values hold `"theme":"stark"`; the page sends the site's own default
theme. The first two are the calls that placed them, made again: a
create whose caller names the thing is refused for the name it took. The
fourth is refused naming the one component the slot expects.

```bash

```
4. A hero in the hero's actions, which expect a call to action: refused, naming the one it expects
Failed: The values were refused:

## Example 14: an optional extension

`/surface-examples/14`, and the webhook at `/surface-examples/14/webhook`

A resource that calls a service takes a credential: a key pasted here, a
secret, or, once a module that manages keys is on, a key the site
manages in its place, with no pasted box beside it. That is the Key
module's pattern. `data_surface_examples_keys` stands in for the Key
module, so nothing contributed is installed, and the examples do not
depend on it, so the page says how to enable it while it is off:

```bash
ddev drush pm:install data_surface_examples_keys
```

Each page shows both resources as they are now, says whether the module
is on, and makes the calls below that the module allows. Two ways reach
the same form, each for the case it fits: the owner declares both
sources, or another module's alter offers the managed key
([decision](../../docs/decisions.md#an-extension-is-a-variant-the-site-adds-or-an-alter)).

### The owner's way: a variant the site adds

The mailer knows the module that manages keys. It declares a source and
a credential whose variants the source chooses, listed by a provider:

<!-- code: src/Resource/MailerResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.mailer', storage: MailerStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure the mailer'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup("Sets who the event's mail is sent from, the mail service it is sent through, and the credential that service is called with: a key pasted here, or a key the site manages."),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class MailerResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('sender', 'email', t('Sender'), default: 'tickets@example.com')
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('endpoint', 'uri', t('Mail service'), default: 'https://mail.example.com/v1/send')
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('source', 'string', t('Credential source'), default: 'pasted')
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->attachVariants('credential', by: 'source', from: CredentialSources::class)
      ->setLabel(t('Credential'));
  }

}
```

The provider lists the pasted source always and the managed one while
the module is on, cacheable by the list of modules and the keys'
configuration, so the second source is there at the next request after
the module is installed, with no cache rebuild. Both are structures of
this module, named once in `structures()`: the provider is closed
(`ClosedVariantsInterface`), so the config schema written from the
resource gives each its own type,
`data_surface_examples.mailer.credential.[%parent.source]`, whichever
the site offers when it is written, where example 12's components are an
open map.

<!-- code: src/Variants/CredentialSources.php -->

```php
final class CredentialSources implements ClosedVariantsInterface, ContainerInjectionInterface {

  use StringTranslationTrait;

  /**
   * The module that manages keys.
   */
  public const KEYS = 'data_surface_examples_keys';

  /**
   * Constructs the provider.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\Extension\ModuleHandlerInterface $moduleHandler
   *   The module handler.
   * @param \Drupal\Core\StringTranslation\TranslationInterface $string_translation
   *   The string translation service.
   */
  public function __construct(
    protected readonly ModuleHandlerInterface $moduleHandler,
    TranslationInterface $string_translation,
  ) {
    $this->stringTranslation = $string_translation;
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function create(ContainerInterface $container): static {
    return new static($container->get('module_handler'), $container->get('string_translation'));
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function structures(): array {
    return [
      'pasted' => PastedCredentialStructure::class,
      'managed' => ManagedCredentialStructure::class,
    ];
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function variants(): VariantList {
    $sources = (new VariantList())
      ->addCacheTags(['config:core.extension', 'config:' . self::KEYS . '.keys'])
      ->addStructure('pasted', $this->t('Pasted here'), self::structures()['pasted']);
    if ($this->moduleHandler->moduleExists(self::KEYS)) {
      $sources->addStructure('managed', $this->t('A managed key'), self::structures()['managed']);
    }
    return $sources;
  }

}
```

<!-- code: src/Structure/PastedCredentialStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.mailer.credential.pasted')]
final class PastedCredentialStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $api_key = $inputs->add('api_key', 'string', t('API key'))
      ->setDescription(t('The key the mail service issued, pasted here.'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    DefinitionMetadata::setSecret($api_key);
  }

}
```

<!-- code: src/Structure/ManagedCredentialStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.mailer.credential.managed')]
final class ManagedCredentialStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('key_id', 'string', t('Key'))
      ->setDescription(t('A key the site manages; its value is read where it is used, never stored here.'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE)
      ->addConstraint('ManagedKey');
  }

}
```

The managed key declares `ManagedKey`, the module's constraint, which
its resolver reads as the keys the site manages, so the form offers them
and both documents state them.

With the module off there is one source, and nothing to choose: the
source is drawn as that source, its label where a select would be, and
posted as it is. Both documents state it as `const`, with the label
under `x-surface.fixed` (the widget hint `fixed`, which the React page
draws as the label), and the credential is the pasted source's def:

```json
{
    "source": {
        "title": "Credential source",
        "type": "string",
        "const": "pasted",
        "default": "pasted",
        "x-surface": {
            "locked": false,
            "dependsOn": [],
            "fixed": "Pasted here"
        }
    },
    "credential": {
        "title": "Credential",
        "anyOf": [
            {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/event.mailer.credential.pasted"
            },
            {
                "type": "null"
            }
        ],
        "x-surface": {
            "locked": false,
            "dependsOn": [
                "source"
            ],
            "by": "source",
            "variants": {
                "pasted": "#/$defs/event.mailer.credential.pasted"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

With the module on, the source offers both, and the credential is
`anyOf` of the two sources' defs, one conditional each:

```json
{
    "source": {
        "title": "Credential source",
        "type": "string",
        "oneOf": [
            {
                "const": "pasted",
                "title": "Pasted here"
            },
            {
                "const": "managed",
                "title": "A managed key"
            }
        ],
        "default": "pasted",
        "x-surface": {
            "locked": false,
            "dependsOn": []
        }
    },
    "credential": {
        "title": "Credential",
        "anyOf": [
            {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/event.mailer.credential.pasted"
            },
            {
                "$ref": "#/$defs/event.mailer.credential.managed"
            },
            {
                "type": "null"
            }
        ],
        "x-surface": {
            "locked": false,
            "dependsOn": [
                "source"
            ],
            "by": "source",
            "variants": {
                "pasted": "#/$defs/event.mailer.credential.pasted",
                "managed": "#/$defs/event.mailer.credential.managed"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The pasted key is a secret: the form draws an empty box, and no answer
returns it. A pasted key stored is kept when the managed source is
chosen, beside the managed key's name, and taken up again when the
pasted source is chosen back, since no caller could send it again; the
managed source's config schema says it may be there. A plain value of
the other source goes, as between any two variants.

### The alter's way: the pasted key ruled out

The webhook does not know the module that manages keys. It declares an
endpoint and a pasted key:

<!-- code: src/Resource/WebhookResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.webhook', storage: WebhookStorage::class)]
#[Operation('configure',
  label: new TranslatableMarkup('Configure the sales webhook'),
  description: new TranslatableMarkup("Sets the address the event's sales are posted to, and the key each post is signed with."),
  permission: 'administer site configuration',
)]
final class WebhookResource implements ResourceInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('endpoint', 'uri', t('Endpoint'), default: 'https://hooks.example.com/sales')
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $api_key = $inputs->add('api_key', 'string', t('API key'))
      ->setDescription(t('The key each post is signed with, pasted here.'));
    DefinitionMetadata::setSecret($api_key);
  }

}
```

The module's alter mounts a managed key on it, draws it right after the
pasted key, and rules the pasted key out once a key is chosen, a rule
declared as data:

<!-- code: ../data_surface_examples_keys/src/Alter/WebhookKeyAlter.php -->

```php
#[Alters(WebhookResource::class)]
final class WebhookKeyAlter implements AltersInputsInterface {

  use StringTranslationTrait;

  /**
   * Constructs the alter, which the container builds as a service.
   *
   * @param \Drupal\Core\StringTranslation\TranslationInterface $string_translation
   *   The string translation service.
   */
  public function __construct(TranslationInterface $string_translation) {
    $this->stringTranslation = $string_translation;
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function alterInputs(BlueprintAdditionsInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('key_id', 'string', $this->t('Key'))
      ->setDescription($this->t('A key the site manages, used in place of a pasted one.'))
      ->addConstraint('ManagedKey');
    $inputs->describe('third_party_settings.data_surface_examples_keys', label: $this->t('Managed key'), after: 'api_key');
    // A managed key chosen: a pasted one means nothing beside it.
    $inputs->narrow('api_key')
      ->when(Condition::present('key_id'))
      ->doesNotApply();
  }

}
```

With a key chosen, the form draws no pasted box, a pasted key sent is
refused naming the managed key, and what is stored for the pasted key is
kept; with the module off, the pasted box is back and the stored key with
it. The full schema states the rule as written, the conditional the
webhook's frame lists under `x-surface.rules`:

```json
[
    {
        "if": {
            "properties": {
                "third_party_settings": {
                    "type": [
                        "object",
                        "null"
                    ],
                    "properties": {
                        "data_surface_examples_keys": {
                            "type": [
                                "object",
                                "null"
                            ],
                            "properties": {
                                "key_id": {
                                    "not": {
                                        "type": "null"
                                    }
                                }
                            },
                            "required": [
                                "key_id"
                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    "required": [
                        "data_surface_examples_keys"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "third_party_settings"
            ]
        },
        "then": {
            "properties": {
                "api_key": false
            }
        }
    }
]
```

The alter ships ruling out. The alternative, not shipped, locks: the
pasted key stays drawn, fixed, and a pasted key sent is noted as not
taken instead of refused. That leaves an empty password box that cannot
be used, and a caller who sends both learns of it only from a note; a
conditional lock is also no effect a declared rule has (ROADMAP item 3
left it out), so this is the spelling it would have:

```php
// Not shipped: the pasted key drawn fixed once a managed key is
// chosen, and a pasted key sent noted as not taken.
$inputs->narrow('api_key')
  ->when(Condition::present('key_id'))
  ->lock();
```

### The gap between the two

What the alter cannot do: hand the webhook's code the managed key's
value. The code that signs a post reads `api_key`, the one key the
webhook declares; the managed key's name is stored under
`third_party_settings.data_surface_examples_keys.key_id`, which belongs
to the module that mounted it, and the webhook never names another
module's keys. So once a managed key is chosen the form, both documents
and the tool are right, and the code that signs has no key to sign with.
The mailer has no such gap: it declares the managed source itself, so
its code reads `credential.key_id` and asks the key service for the
value.

An alter supplying the value it rules out, so the owner's code would
read it at `api_key`, is [ROADMAP](../../ROADMAP.md) item 18, designed
and not built.

### The calls

Made on the settings the module ships, with the module that manages
keys on, each a dry run but the read. The first is a write rehearsed,
since a page that makes its calls whenever it is drawn writes nothing:
the secret is in no answer. The second chooses the managed source; the
third sends a pasted key beside it and is refused, naming the source
that chose the other variant; the fourth reads what is stored, with the
pasted key left out. A managed key stored would be read by its name. The
webhook's three: a pasted key, a managed key, and both, refused naming
the key the pasted one depends on. With the module off, the page makes
only the calls that need nothing of it.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.mailer:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"source":"pasted","credential":{"api_key":"mk-example-7f3a91"}}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```

## Example 15: a config entity of your own

`/surface-examples/15`, with the forms at `/surface-examples/15/add`,
`/surface-examples/15/venue/{id}` and `/surface-examples/15/venue/{id}/delete`

A module that declares its own config entity type puts a resource over
it from the start. The venue is a config entity,
`data_surface_examples.event_venue.<id>`, declared with core's
`#[ConfigEntityType]` attribute and `config_export`, with no form
classes, no list builder and no links: the resource's operations create,
update and delete a venue at every door, and its routes are the forms.

<!-- code: src/Entity/EventVenue.php -->

```php
#[ConfigEntityType(

```

The resource is the venue by its machine name, on a `VenueStorage`, a
`ConfigEntityStorage`. Create, update and delete are about one venue. Listing
and reordering are about the venues together, so they name none: each
takes the keys of a structure of its own, which `values:` on its
`#[Operation]` names. The listing is read only; the reorder is an update
over the collection. Neither is a new kind of operation.

The slug is a computed key, `derive()`: a key of the venue, stored and
read like any other, whose value nobody types. `Slugify` computes it
from the name, once, when the venue is added (`when:` is
`Derive::ON_CREATE` unless it says `Derive::ON_CHANGE`), so renaming a
venue leaves its links working. The pipeline computes it after it
accepts the rest and judges it by its own pattern; the storage refuses
a slug another venue holds, and the refusal names the name, the key a
caller can change. Both documents state it `readOnly` with
`x-surface.computed: {"from": ["label"], "when": "create"}`, the write
tool's `values` leaves it out, the read answers it, and the form draws
it fixed. A slug sent equal to the one the venue holds is noted and not
taken; any other is refused.

<!-- code: src/Slugify.php -->

```php
final class Slugify implements DeriverInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function derive(array $from): mixed {
    $slug = trim((string) preg_replace('/[^a-z0-9]+/', '-', mb_strtolower((string) ($from['label'] ?? ''))), '-');
    return $slug === '' ? NULL : $slug;
  }

}
```

The listing takes a page and a filter, and declares what it answers,
`defineOutputs()`: the page, a list of venues, and how many matched.
Its tool is `data_surface:event.venue:list`, a read with no dry run.

<!-- code: src/Structure/VenueListingStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.venue.listing')]

The reorder takes a collection of venues and their weights:

<!-- code: src/Structure/VenueReorderStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.venue.reorder')]
final class VenueReorderStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->attachList('venues', VenueOrderStructure::class, min: 1)
      ->setLabel(t('Venues'))
      ->setDescription(t('Each venue to move, once, with its new weight; a venue left out keeps its own.'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
  }

}
```

<!-- code: src/Structure/VenueOrderStructure.php -->

```php
#[Structure('event.venue.order')]
final class VenueOrderStructure implements StructureInterface {

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public static function defineInputs(BlueprintInterface $inputs): void {
    $inputs->add('id', 'string', t('Venue'))
      ->setDescription(t('The machine name of a venue the site has.'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE);
    $inputs->add('weight', 'integer', t('Weight'))
      ->setDescription(t('Its place among the venues: lighter first.'))
      ->setRequired(TRUE)
      ->addConstraint('Range', ['min' => -1000, 'max' => 1000]);
  }

}
```

The storage is where the venues are read and written together. A
listing loads nothing, since a query has nothing stored, and its
`prepare()` is its answer: prepare is the last stage a read runs, and
one with no side effects, so the page and the total are what the tool
answers beside the one result shape. Each venue is asked the resource's
access answer in the listing's own context, knowing that venue, and one
whose answer is not allowed is left out of the page and of the total. A
reorder loads every venue's id and weight; its `prepare()` refuses an id
that names no venue or is named twice, by its place in the list, and
rehearses the rest; `commit()` saves them, in that one write.

The access class is what the listing filters by: a disabled venue is
only for an account that administers the venues, which only the venue
can say, so an account that only views them lists the enabled ones.

### The config schema, written from the resource

`drush data_surface:config-schema --write` writes the entity type's
config schema from the resource, as it writes a config object's: a
fully validatable `config_entity`, each key the storage maps to a
property, by the rules a config object's keys follow. The three venues
the module ships are config of their own, which no resource describes,
so no install file is written.

### On HTTP

With `data_surface_react` on, the collection is the resource, one venue
its path, and the method the operation. `GET` on the collection answers
the listing, since the resource declares one: its query string the
listing's values, its answer the outputs. A resource with no listing
answers its create's envelope there, which is the create's custom
method here, `GET /surface-api/event.venue:create`. The reorder is a custom
method run with `PATCH`, the method an update takes.

| Method | Path | Operation | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/surface-api/event.venue?limit=2` | `list` | the listing: its outputs, a page of venues and the total |
| `POST` | `/surface-api/event.venue` | `create` | 201 with the new venue's Location |
| `GET` | `/surface-api/event.venue:create` | `create` | the envelope a create starts from |
| `GET` | `/surface-api/event.venue/riverside` | `update` | the envelope: what is stored, its schema and its ETag |
| `PATCH` | `/surface-api/event.venue/riverside` | `update` | the update, held by If-Match |
| `DELETE` | `/surface-api/event.venue/riverside` | `delete` | the removal, no body |
| `PATCH` | `/surface-api/event.venue:reorder` | `reorder` | the reorder, a custom method on the collection |
| `GET` | `/surface-api/event.venue/schema` | `list` | the listing's full schema, its inputs and its outputs |

```
GET /surface-api/event.venue?limit=2

{"items":[{"id":"riverside","label":"Riverside Hall","capacity":520,"weight":0},{"id":"library","label":"Old Library","capacity":90,"weight":1}],"total":3}
```

The React pages are `/surface-react/event.venue/create` and
`/surface-react/event.venue/update?id=riverside`.

### The calls

Made in order on the venues the module ships, as the page draws them:
the listing, two to a page; Town Hall added as a dry run, then for
real, so the next calls find it; Town Hall read back, its slug computed
from its name; its capacity changed; a rename rehearsed, the slug kept
as it was set; a venue sent with a slug of its own, refused naming the
key the slug is computed from; a reorder rehearsed, Town Hall first and
Riverside Hall last; a reorder that names a venue the site does not
have and one twice, refused by the storage at each place; Town Hall's
removal rehearsed, then made, so the three venues shipped are what is
left. The calls never touch a venue
the site has: where one is named `town_hall` already, the page makes
each call as a dry run, says so, and writes nothing.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:list --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"limit":2}}'
```

```
1. The venues listed, two to a page
Success: List the venues changes nothing: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"offset":0,"limit":2,"status":null}
  items: [{"id":"riverside","label":"Riverside Hall","capacity":520,"weight":0},{"id":"library","label":"Old Library","capacity":90,"weight":1}]
  total: 3
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:create --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"label":"Town Hall","id":"town_hall","capacity":300,"address":"1 Market Square","rooms":[{"id":"town_hall_council","label":"Council chamber","seats":120},{"id":"town_hall_foyer","label":"Foyer","seats":80}],"weight":3}}' --input=dry_run=true

```

```
3. Town Hall added: written, so the next calls find it
Success: Add a venue: the values were accepted and written.
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:update:read --uid=1 --input='{"id":"town_hall"}'
```

```
4. Town Hall read back: its slug, computed from its name
Success: Edit a venue: the stored values were read, and nothing was written.
  values: {"label":"Town Hall","slug":"town-hall","capacity":300,"address":"1 Market Square","rooms":[{"id":"town_hall_council","label":"Council chamber","seats":120},{"id":"town_hall_foyer","label":"Foyer","seats":80}],"weight":3,"status":true}
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:update --uid=1 --input='{"id":"town_hall","values":{"capacity":350}}'
```

```
5. Town Hall's capacity changed: written
Success: Edit a venue: the values were accepted and written.
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:update --uid=1 --input='{"id":"town_hall","values":{"label":"Town Hall and Annex"}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
6. Town Hall renamed, rehearsed: the slug stays as it was set
Success: Dry run of Edit a venue: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"label":"Town Hall and Annex","id":"town_hall","slug":"town-hall","capacity":350,"address":"1 Market Square","rooms":[{"id":"town_hall_council","label":"Council chamber","seats":120},{"id":"town_hall_foyer","label":"Foyer","seats":80}],"weight":3,"status":true}

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:create --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"label":"Concert Hall","id":"concert_hall","capacity":500,"slug":"concerts"}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
7. A venue sent a slug of its own: refused, naming the key it is computed from
Failed: The values were refused:
/slug: Slug is computed from label and takes no value of its own; leave it out.
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:reorder --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"venues":[{"id":"town_hall","weight":-1},{"id":"riverside","weight":4}]}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
8. Town Hall moved first and Riverside Hall last, in one write: rehearsed

```

```
9. A reorder naming a venue the site does not have, and one twice: refused
Failed: The values were refused:
/venues/0/id: No venue is named concert_hall.
/venues/2/id: The library venue is named already, at position 1: a reorder names each venue once.
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:delete --uid=1 --input='{"id":"town_hall"}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
10. Town Hall removed: rehearsed
Success: Dry run of Remove a venue: the removal was rehearsed, and nothing was removed. The values it holds are answered.
  values: {"id":"town_hall","label":"Town Hall","slug":"town-hall","capacity":350,"address":"1 Market Square","rooms":[{"id":"town_hall_council","label":"Council chamber","seats":120},{"id":"town_hall_foyer","label":"Foyer","seats":80}],"weight":3,"status":true}
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.venue:delete --uid=1 --input='{"id":"town_hall"}'
```

```
11. Town Hall removed: written, so the three venues shipped are what is left
Success: Remove a venue: removed. The values it held are answered.

## Example 16: references, three ways

`/surface-examples/16`, once its module is on:

```bash
drush pm:install data_surface_examples_references
```

The module needs node: the sponsorship's announcement is an article. It
ships the article and page bundles as optional config, for a site that
has neither, a role, Sponsorship editor, and when it is installed it
writes three nodes the calls name: an article, a draft article and a
page. Uninstalled, it deletes them.

A key that refers to an entity is declared by the data type string of
what it refers to, and stores the entity's id, as the entity type keeps
it: an integer for a node or a user, a string for a venue.

<!-- code: ../data_surface_examples_references/src/Resource/SponsorshipResource.php -->

```php
#[Resource('event.sponsorship', storage: SponsorshipStorage::class)]

      ->addConstraint('DataSurfaceReferenceableType', [
        'targets' => ['node' => ['article'], 'user' => []],
      ]);
  }

}
```

| Key | Declared as | What it builds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `venue` | `entity:event_venue` | a string, the venue's machine name, with `DataSurfaceValidReference` naming the entity type |
| `contact` | `entity:user` | an integer, a user's id, with the same constraint |
| `page` | `entity:node:article` | an integer, a node's id, the constraint naming the bundle too |
| `thing` | `entity`, content entities | two keys attached at the key: `entity_type`, a choice of the content entity types the account may reference one of, and `id`, a string, which a refiner narrows to the entity type chosen with the same constraint |
| `setting` | `entity`, config entities among three | the same two keys; of the three entity types it names, node is no config entity, so the venue and the role are offered |
| `credit` | `entity`, an article or a user | the same two keys; the bundle list narrows a node's id to articles |

Which entities a key may name is core's entity reference selection
handler's answer for the account asking: the `default` handler for the
entity type, the bundle as its target bundles, sorted by label. Its query
carries the entity type's access tag, so a node's leaves out unpublished
nodes for an account without "bypass node access", and a user's leaves
out blocked users without "administer users". The list varies by what
the handler read, `user.permissions` and, for a node, `user.node_grants:view`.

While the site has at most 50 candidates, the setting
`data_surface.settings:reference_enum_limit`, the key lists them: a
select on the form, a `oneOf` with their labels in both documents, an
enum in the tool listing. Past it, the key is an id: core's
`entity_autocomplete` element on the form, `x-surface.widget:
autocomplete` and the constraint under `checkedOnServer` in both
documents, and a sentence in the tool listing naming where to look one
up: the resource's lookup, `GET
/surface-api/event.sponsorship:lookup?key=/contact&q=adm`, which answers
ids and labels through the same handler, for the same account. Both
documents mark every reference key `x-surface.reference`, `{"entityType":
"node", "bundles": ["article"]}`, or for a bare key's id `{"by":
"entity_type"}`. The page shows the keys as the full schema states them
now, and again with the limit held at 1 for its own request, as
`ddev drush config:set data_surface.settings reference_enum_limit 1`
would set it, without saving it.

### The calls

Made on the settings the module ships and the three nodes it wrote, each
a dry run. The draft is sent as an account whose only role is
Sponsorship editor, which may not see unpublished content; Drush names
that account by its id, which the site chose when it made it.

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.sponsorship:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"venue":"library","contact":1,"page":1,"thing":{"entity_type":"node","id":1}}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
1. A venue, a contact, an article and a node of any content type: accepted
Success: Dry run of Configure the sponsorship: the values were accepted and prepared, and nothing was written.
  values: {"venue":"library","contact":1,"page":1,"thing":{"entity_type":"node","id":"1"},"setting":{"entity_type":null},"credit":{"entity_type":null}}
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.sponsorship:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"page":3}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
2. A page where an article is asked for: refused
Failed: The values were refused:
/page: This entity (node: 3) cannot be referenced.
```

```bash
# UID: an account whose only role, beside authenticated, is event_sponsorship_editor.
drush tool:run data_surface:event.sponsorship:configure --uid="$UID" --input='{"values":{"page":2}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
3. The draft article, as an account that may not see unpublished content: refused
Failed: The values were refused:
/page: This entity (node: 2) cannot be referenced.
```

```bash
drush tool:run data_surface:event.sponsorship:configure --uid=1 --input='{"values":{"setting":{"entity_type":"node","id":1}}}' --input=dry_run=true
```

```
4. A node where a config entity is asked for: refused
Failed: The values were refused:
/setting/id: ID does not apply.
/setting/entity_type: The entity type node cannot be referenced here.
```

## How this page is kept true

Every code block above is the file it names, from its first attribute
or its class line to its closing brace, and `ExamplesReadmeTest` fails
when one drifts, and so does the component example 12 quotes. Each
example's Files table is its list in `Series`, the one its page and the
landing page's reading order are drawn from, and `ExampleFilesTest`
fails when a table and the list differ, or the list and the module. The Drush
commands and answers of examples 7 to 16 are asserted by
`ExamplesConceptsToolTest`, and example 15's config schema entry is the
schema file's, which `ExamplesReadmeTest` checks. The JSON of example 1's config schema is asserted by
`ConfigSchemaContractTest`, which also checks this page quotes it. The tool's three answers are asserted by
`ExamplesToolTest`, which also checks this page quotes them, and the
Drush commands are checked against `ExampleCalls`.

| Test | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `Kernel\ExamplesStepsTest` | Examples 1 to 3: each form builds and saves, example 1 as its classic twin does; example 2's twin refuses a capacity beyond the room's seats or below 1 in the resource's words and stores a valid set as the resource does; the venue narrows the room and the room the capacity; the pricing chooses the ticket variant; the contact validates its email; the panel's rows as the answers move; each example's class stays screen sized. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesComplianceTest` | Example 4: the alter's keys and label; its keys in one fieldset titled "Compliance", drawn between the capacity and the pricing; the capacity capped at a hundred without a license and the room's limit with one; the license's pattern; the stewards' minimum following the capacity; what the license and the capacity replace on the form; a room closed in State left out, said in the room's help, and refused on submit; example 5's calls unchanged. |
| `Kernel\StaticRefinerEnforcementTest` | Examples 2 and 3, without example 4 and with it: every conditional the served contract enumerates, in the full schema and in the schema for no values and for the defaults, is what refining afresh for its values answers, and example 4's declared license rule is what refining with the rules alone answers for sampled values. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesToolTest` | Example 5: the three calls and their answers; what the script prints. |
| `Kernel\ConfigSchemaContractTest` | What config schema can say: the plain mapping of examples 1 and 3, whole, with no list, no bound, nothing required and no keys for the ticket, the same whatever is stored or mounted; core's answer, a comment and no property; a constraint a schema does declare is said; the JSON this page quotes. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesTodayPanelTest` | The second panel under examples 1 to 3: its two documents and its table, row by row; its rows read from the resource's full schema, so the pricing, the venue and what is stored leave every row and both documents as they were; example 4's keys on the resource's side only; the classic twins' pages, example 2's with its two line counts. |
| `Unit\ExamplesReadmeTest` | This page against the files it quotes, its Drush commands, and the two line counts it states for example 2's twin. |
| `Unit\ExampleFilesTest` | Each example's files in `Series`: every one there, every resource, storage, structure, shape, provider, access class, alter, component, route, config schema entry and shipped settings file of the examples listed by one example, what a listed class names listed with it or before it, each docs page and decision there, the line counts, and each Files table on this page the list's. |
| `Functional\ExamplesRoutesTest` | Every route answers an administrator and refuses anonymous; the landing page; both panels under example 3, and a save through it; each classic twin's page with its two documents, and a save through it; example 2's twin linked from the landing page with its line counts, and its page saying them; the Files panel of examples 1 to 5, the twins included, each file linked with its lines of code and a short one shown whole; the landing page's reading order, one row per example from `Series`. |
| `Functional\ExamplesStep2ClassicTest` | Example 2 and its twin posted the same answers without JavaScript: a room of another venue refused on the room by both, a capacity beyond the room's seats and one below 1 refused by both in the same words, and a valid set stored identically by each. |
| `FunctionalJavascript\ExamplesStep2ClassicAjaxTest` | Example 2's twin in a browser: a new venue swaps the room's options and leaves it on "- Select -" with nothing stored changed, a room describes the capacity, the venue moved back shows the stored room again, and a save after a move writes the new venue and room. |
| `FunctionalJavascript\ExamplesAjaxRefreshTest` | In a browser: example 2's venue replaces the room and the capacity and leaves the venue the same node, the orphaned room on its empty option with the stale marker and the capacity with no upper bound; a room then narrows the capacity and loses `- Select -`. Example 3's paid pricing swaps the note for a price and a currency, and leaves the second panel's table and its two documents as they were. |
| `FunctionalJavascript\ExamplesComplianceRefreshTest` | Example 4, in a browser: one fieldset titled "Compliance", the ceiling of 100 lifted to the main hall's 400 by `2048`, and the stewards at 1 for 50 and 3 for 150; a malformed license on blur is said once, under the license, with `aria-invalid` and nothing at the top, and caps the capacity at a hundred; corrected, the error goes and the room's limit comes back. A refused capacity left by a click on text keeps no focus, and left by Tab lands on the Compliance fieldset after it. The fieldset is drawn below the capacity and above the pricing, and stays there when `2048` and Tab lift the capacity, which, with the stewards, is all that is replaced. With the East room closed in State, choosing Riverside Hall offers the main hall alone and says why. |
| `Functional\ServedContractEndpointsTest` | In React: the landing page's links, and example 2's contract, refine and validate over HTTP. |
| `Functional\ServedSubmitEndpointTest` | In React: example 2 saved over HTTP, refused, and refused after someone else saved. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesResetTest` | Reset to defaults puts every example, and what another module stored on example 3, back to the shipped files, puts example 15's venues back as shipped, a venue removed made again and one added removed, and opens every room example 4 closed. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesConceptsTest` | Examples 7 to 12 and 14: each form builds and saves; example 7's rules in the full schema as declared, the send day gone for a monthly bulletin and kept in storage; example 8's one def at two sites with each wiring, the mixed-in keys flat, the shape at two keys, the volunteers' collection; example 9's keys from the configuration, a type added without a cache rebuild, the locked type in both documents and on the form; example 10's fees for two accounts, locked once published, and both operations' facts and tools; example 11's widgets, the always held badges and the notes that clear; example 12's four components read as four variants at the props and again at the slots, the card's props as keys with their constraints, its text a slot, both documents stating them, the form swapped to the hero and saved with its slot, a hero too dark refused; the panel above each, and none above examples 1 to 3; each class stays screen sized; example 13's page with its modules off, saying how to enable both, then with the block alone on, its parts and no call, then with the placement resource on too, the Spotlight and Tonight blocks placed through the create operation, the three lines side by side, the block's contract cut to the four components, the hero's actions narrowed, the four placement tools and the five calls' answers, nothing written.; example 14's panel with its module off, then on: how to enable it, the one source and then two in the contract excerpt, the webhook's rule, the gap, the lock not shipped, and the calls each state allows. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesWorkflowTest` | Example 10 with the workflow module: the fees left out of the full schema, the tool listing and the read tool for an account without "see event fees" and kept for one with it; the program locked whole once the workflow state is published, settled at call time and left unmarked in the full schema; checking still answers; the panel's paragraph, with the module and without it. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesConceptsToolTest` | Examples 7 to 16: every call `ConceptCalls` writes down, its answer, nothing left written, the two blocks and the venues included, and this page quoting each command and answer. |
| `Kernel\VenueResourceTest` | Example 15: the entity type installs with its three venues and holds to its generated schema; the resource builds for each operation; both documents of create, update, list and reorder; the listing's outputs schema; the tools, the listing paged and filtered and an account that only views left without the disabled venue; the reorder written in one commit, and refused for an unknown venue and one named twice; the slug computed from the name on create and kept on a rename, left out of the write and in the read, a slug sent equal noted and another refused, one another venue holds refused naming the name, and the post-update writing a missing one; example 2 offering a venue added, with no cache rebuild. |
| `Functional\VenueApiTest` | Example 15 over HTTP and through its forms: `GET` on the collection answering the listing, a refused query, `POST` 201 with `Location`, the slug written and read, `POST .../schema` answering the slug it would compute, a `PATCH` sending another slug refused, the venue's `PATCH` and `DELETE`, the reorder's `PATCH` and its 405 for `POST`; the create and update forms saving, the slug drawn fixed; the delete form's confirmation removing; the page and its calls. |
| `Kernel\ReferenceKeysTest` | Example 16: the three spellings and what each builds; both documents of the sponsorship pinned whole under the limit and past it, under `tests/fixtures/references/`; the candidates the account's, cached by what they read; the refusals, in one message; the lookup and what it leaves out; the tool listing's enum and the sentence naming the lookup; the OpenAPI document's lookup; the page's panel. |
| `Functional\ReferenceKeysFormTest` | Example 16 without JavaScript: a select up to the limit, core's entity autocomplete past it, the id saved either way and refused in the constraint's words; the lookup answering, refusing an account without the permission and leaving the draft out for one that may not see it; the React page told where the lookup is, and the full schema stating a bare key's id per entity type. |
| `Functional\ExamplesConceptsRoutesTest` | Every route of examples 7 to 12 and 14 answers an administrator and refuses anonymous; the landing page lists them; each page shows its panel and its Files panel and saves through its form; example 10's check writes nothing. Example 13 refuses anonymous, says to enable its two modules, then, with them on, shows its parts and the calls' answers, and draws the Spotlight card and the Tonight section below on its page alone; its Files panel, the modules on or off. |
| `Kernel\ExamplesExtensionTest` | Example 14 with the module that manages keys off, then on: both resources' full schemas, whole; the one source stated as `const` and drawn fixed, then two; the second source and the managed key there with no cache rebuild, in the documents and the tool; a pasted key kept across a switch to the managed key and back, and the config schema each source's stored value holds to; the read tool leaving the pasted key out and naming the managed key; the refusals, a pasted key sent while the managed source is chosen, a pasted key beside a managed key on the webhook, a key the site does not manage; the webhook's pasted key back with its value once the module is off; and this page quoting the documents, the gap and the lock it does not ship. |
| `Functional\ExamplesExtensionFormTest` | Example 14 through its forms without JavaScript: the one source drawn as its label and no select, then a select of two; the mailer's pasted key saved, the managed key chosen and the pasted source chosen back with nothing typed, the key kept; the webhook's pasted box gone once a managed key is saved, and back when the module is off. |
| `Kernel\ComponentBlockTest` | Example 13's block: its structure and both documents, the hero's narrowed slot pinned, and what it renders, slots included ([its README](../data_surface_component_block/README.md)). |
| `Kernel\ComponentSlotsTest` | What a slot expects read back from the metadata, the depth slots nest to, and each expectation a refusal. |
| `Kernel\BlockPlacementToolsTest` | Example 13's block placed, configured, read and removed through the placement resource's tools ([its README](../data_surface_block/README.md)). |
| `Functional\ComponentBlockPlacementTest` | Example 13's block through the block form without JavaScript. |
| `FunctionalJavascript\ComponentBlockAjaxTest` | Example 13's block in a browser: a component chosen draws its props and slots over AJAX, a slot's kind switched draws what it holds, a nested component chosen draws its own props, and the block saved renders it. |
| `FunctionalJavascript\ExamplesSpotlightAjaxTest` | Example 12 in a browser: choosing the hero swaps the card's props for the hero's over AJAX, the form saved stores the hero and its props, and the page read back draws them. |
| `Kernel\SchemaRoundTripTest` | Every example's full schema, read back by the reader, is itself again, byte for byte, or differs only as its listed kind says. |
