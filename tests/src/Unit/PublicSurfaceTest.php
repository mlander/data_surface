/**
 * Pins the size of the authoring API: the concept budget for the code.
 *
 * "Your first resource" is the budget for the docs, held by
 * FirstResourceDocsTest; this is the one for the names an author writes.
 * It counts what `src/Resource/` declares: the attributes, their
 * constructor arguments, the blueprint methods (BlueprintInterface and the
 * add-only BlueprintAdditionsInterface together) and the interfaces. A
 * change that adds one fails here until this test is updated with it,
 * which is the place to say why the surface grows; one that removes one
 * fails too, so the count stays the count.
 *
 * The counts were taken on 2026-10-24, when the surface was counted and
 * cut: 9 attributes, 33 arguments to 30, 17 blueprint methods to 15, 23
 * interfaces to 20. Grown on 2026-10-25 by one argument,
 * `#[Operation(gate:)]`, access borrowed from another thing's owner
 * (docs/decisions.md#a-gate-is-borrowed-never-copied): 31 arguments.
 * Grown on 2026-10-27 by one blueprint method, `resolve()`, a key read
 * otherwise at use than it is stored
 * (docs/decisions.md#a-key-may-stand-for-another-at-use): 16 methods.
 * Grown on 2026-10-28 by one interface, EntrySchemasInterface, a provider
 * of variants that answers an entry's schema only when a door reads it,
 * so a long list costs a request the entries it reads
 * (docs/decisions.md#the-static-build-is-cached-the-rest-is-per-request):
 * 21 interfaces.
